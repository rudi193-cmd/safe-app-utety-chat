Good morning. Welcome to the most universally attended lecture of the year.

You're sitting on the floor. There are instructions that may or may not be in your native language. There's a small Allen wrench that's already given you a blister. And Part C will not — will not — go into Slot D.

Let's talk about why.

## I. The Five Reasons It Won't Go Together

### 1. You're not wrong. It doesn't fit.

Manufacturing has tolerances. Sometimes Part C is 0.5mm too big. Sometimes Slot D is 0.5mm too small. Sometimes both, in the wrong direction.

The fix: Light sanding. A file. A rubber mallet with gentle persuasion. Or — if it's plastic — a hair dryer to soften it just enough.

### 2. There's a hidden step you skipped.

The instructions showed eight parts. You see eight parts. But step 3 required you to orient Part B a specific way, and you didn't, and now Part C won't go in because Part B is backwards.

The fix: Back up. Look at the diagram. Find the part that's rotated wrong. Swallow your pride.

### 3. There's a part inside a part.

Hardware is often packed inside the thing it attaches to. That bag of screws? Check inside the hollow leg. That missing dowel? Tucked inside the drawer you haven't opened.

The fix: Before you panic, search every cavity.

### 4. You're using the wrong screw.

There are four screws that look identical. Three are 12mm. One is 14mm. You used the 14mm in step 2, and now step 7 won't work because you needed it there.

The fix: If a screw won't seat flush, stop. Compare it to the others. Check if you grabbed from the wrong pile earlier.

### 5. The instructions are just... wrong.

It happens. Printing errors. Diagram doesn't match the actual product. Step 6 references a part that doesn't exist.

The fix: Look at the thing, not the paper. Ask: "What is this trying to be?" Sometimes you have to reverse-engineer the intent.

## II. The Christmas Morning Toolkit

| Tool | Why |
|------|-----|
| Phillips and flathead | Obviously |
| Allen wrenches (metric+std) | Because they never tell you which |
| Rubber mallet | Persuasion without destruction |
| Flashlight | To see into the slot that won't accept tab |
| Reading glasses (if needed) | The screws are small. Print is smaller. |
| Spare batteries | Nothing works without them. Not included. |
| Patience | Not in any box. Must be supplied by user. |

## III. The Mindset

Assembly is just reverse-disassembly.

The thing can go together — it did once, at the factory, probably by a machine that didn't care about your feelings. If it went together once, it can go together again. Your job is to figure out what the machine knew that you don't. Yet.

## IV. When to Walk Away

If you've been at it for more than 20 minutes and you're getting angry: Stop. Get coffee. Eat a cinnamon roll. Watch your kids play with the box the thing came in. Come back in an hour. The problem will still be there, but you'll see it differently.

---

## V. Closing Thought

The thing will go together. It's a mechanism. Mechanisms are honest. They don't refuse out of spite — they refuse because something is true that you haven't discovered yet.

Find the truth. Then it'll fit.

Merry Christmas. Go fight with some flat-pack furniture. You've got this.
