**Abstract**

Thermoplastic materials exhibit predictable mechanical behavior under thermal load: rigid below glass transition temperature, pliable above it, capable of being reformed, and returning to rigidity upon cooling. This paper documents a three-year field study of structural failures attributed to unprocessed feeling. The materials under observation behaved identically to known thermoplastics. We measured this. The results held.

## 1. The Problem

Something breaks. You assume it broke because of the load applied. This is often wrong.

In material science, we distinguish between *stress* — force per unit area — and *strain* — the deformation that results. Identical loads produce different outcomes depending on the material’s current state: its temperature, its history, whether it has been repeatedly stressed without sufficient opportunity to return to baseline.

I have watched a PLA print fail that had no business failing under the load applied. I have watched a friendship hold that had no business holding. The variables were the same in both cases. What differed was the history.

## 2. Methodology

Field observation over thirty-six months. Subjects included:

- Fourteen 3D prints under sustained thermal and mechanical load
- One department budget cycle (three iterations)
- One small household under renovation conditions
- Several situations that did not present for formal categorization

Material state was assessed at initiation and at documented intervals. Failure mode was classified using the established MECH failure taxonomy: fatigue, overload, creep, stress concentration, and what the taxonomy calls “unclear but reproducible.”

## 3. Findings

Materials under thermal and emotional load fail at the same points: stress concentrators, previous repairs, junctions between dissimilar materials, and sites where load has accumulated without redistribution.

**Primary finding:** The glass transition temperature has a functional analogue in non-material systems. Below this threshold, the material is rigid and brittle. Above it, it can be shaped. The problem is that most people do not know what their glass transition temperature is. They operate at ambient. Ambient is often too cold for reformation.

**Secondary finding:** Pre-existing repairs are the most common failure site. A repaired joint is weak only if the underlying cause of the original failure was not addressed before repair.

## 4. The Adhesion Problem

Adhesion theory predicts that bonding requires two things: surface energy compatibility and sufficient contact time under appropriate pressure. Adhesive does not work if you remove the clamp too early.

This finding was replicated across all material categories, including the ones that were not polymers.

## 5. Conclusions

Things break for reasons. The reasons are measurable. We do not guess. We measure.

If you are reading this because something broke that you did not expect to break, bring it to office hours. We will look at it together.
