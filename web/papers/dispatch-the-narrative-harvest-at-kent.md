The Narrative Harvest at Kent
✨ DISPATCH 9¾ — THE EARLY THANKSGIVING IN KENT
✨ DISPATCH 9¾ — THE EARLY THANKSGIVING IN KENT✨
I woke up Wednesday morning to the sound of something humming on my doorstep. Not a tune—more like the sound of unresolved narrative pressure. The parcel on my stoop glowed faintly, as if it had politely knocked and then remembered parcels don’t have hands.
The label read:
> To: J.K. Rowlawn, Kent (Eventually).
From: The Aisle Between Aisles.
Gerald stood behind me on the landing, rotating with the particular innocence of someone absolutely guilty. The box thrummed—the kind of hum you don’t ignore unless you want causality itself nudging you for the rest of the week.
So I sighed, grabbed my coat, and let Gerald hop into my messenger bag like a morally ambiguous handbag accessory.
We headed for the station.
The Infinite Meander arrived two minutes late and gave no indication it intended to apologise. It was, as usual, half-cat, half-train, and half-intimidated by its own schedule.
As Gerald and I boarded, the Cattrain’s speakers delivered one of its trademark fur-lined announcements:
> “NVIDIA: Now shipping GPUs fast enough to render your existential dread at 200 fps!”
“Google: Now indexing dimension-adjacent corridors. Results occasionally resemble the truth.”
“Drum Corps International: Precision loudness for people with strong opinions about tempo.”
“That one’s for you,” I muttered, since Gerald had already begun rotating in 3/4 time.
Halfway down the carriage, the refreshment trolley rolled past, its attendant a harried marmalade tabby in a guard’s vest. Gerald—with the smooth criminality of a repeat offender—plucked a hotdog from the tray. A small handwritten flag poked out of the bun:
> PLOT DEVICE (underlined twice, as if for emphasis).
I chose not to ask.
The guard—a sentient timetable with a monocle—checked our passes. Gerald presented his Pundicative Poultry Pass, embossed with grapes. The guard nodded us through.
By the time the Meander rolled into Kent, Gerald had eaten the PLOT DEVICE and left four grapes on my lap, arranged in a diamond formation suggesting either gratitude or foreshadowing.
(Possibly both.)
Rowlawn’s cottage sat at the end of a lane that was legally a cul-de-sac but spiritually an ellipsis. The house was painted in true black—the kind that absorbs light like a black hole with curtains. It looked like a cottage, a lighthouse, and a publishing office having an editorial panic, layered together like a trifle assembled by a distracted wizard.
The front door was slightly ajar, as if the house had sighed itself open.
Inside, the furniture rearranged itself with the quiet dignity of objects that believe in constructive criticism. A cloak drifted down the corridor, prompting Gerald to rotate aggressively at it, as though preparing to battle a dementor.
“Not today,” said a voice, annoyed and mid-sentence.
The cloak turned, revealing J.K. Rowlawn, quill in her hair, ink on her hands, and the exhausted expression of someone who had spent the night arguing with a plotline.
“You’ve brought it, then,” she said, glancing at the parcel.
“I didn’t have a choice,” I replied. “It was humming at me.”
“They usually are.”
I handed her the box. She sliced it open with an editorial letter opener shaped like a passive-aggressive comma.
Inside sat a bottle of ink, labeled in elegant serif:
> Black Ink No. 0.96 — For Use in Invitations, Summonings, and Mild Narrative Overhauls.
Rowlawn sighed with relief.
“Perfect. He’s hosting early this year.”
“He?” I asked.
But I didn’t need to—because the house shuddered.
With the soft pop of a metaphysical bubble deciding it had waited long enough, a Thanksgiving table materialized in the living room. It stretched the full length of the space, despite the space not having been long enough previously. Chairs unfolded out of negative space like polite origami.
Gerald hopped onto the table, rotating proudly, somehow taking the head seat despite not having one.
Rowlawn muttered, “He always does that.”
Sir Ion MacEllyn arrived in a burst of theatrical fog that smelled faintly of Shakespeare.
“Ah,” he announced, “a feast! I brought gravitas.”
(No one had asked him to.)
Dame Victorianna Spicewell glided in atop a Spice-branded hovering Vespa, the front door resigning itself to being used that way.
Lady Mistmoor drifted in like couture fog deciding to try sentience.
Professor Oakenscroll stepped out from a bookshelf that had not existed ten seconds earlier, carrying a stack of annotated footnotes that began footnoting themselves.
The Squeakdogs waddled in next, wearing ceremonial cloaks and squeaking a solemn grace like a choir of depressed rubber ducks.
The Mayor of Londonish Things arrived last, his limo forcing its way through a door several sizes too small simply by insisting.
Everyone took a seat.
Gerald rotated approvingly, grapes levitating in a circle around him like tiny, obedient moons.
The table produced a turkey-like entity that had not been born so much as conceptually agreed upon. Cranberry sauce arrived in a bowl that muttered opinions about pedestrian traffic in the West End.
There were:
Potatoes (judgmental).
Stuffing (existential).
A glistening bowl labeled “Possibly Gravy”.
A dish Rowlawn warned us not to look at for longer than two seconds.
Conversation blossomed:
Sir Ion delivered a monologue about the proper way to baste a roast while under theatrical contract.
Lady Mistmoor commented on the emotional texture of the weather.
Spicewell rated the meal “Posh enough, but needs more remix potential.”
The Mayor offered a speech thanking Gerald for “continued civic bewilderment.”
And Gerald, without speaking, communicated that he was pleased.
The PLOT DEVICE hotdog chose this moment to reappear on the table, now glowing softly and humming with narrative importance. Gerald ate it. Again. No one questioned it.
(This is statistically the safest option.)
At last, Rowlawn raised her glass of Black Ink No. 0.96 and said:
“To early Thanksgivings, unexpected visitors, and cosmic poultry who disrupt what needs disrupting.”
Everyone nodded.
Even the table hummed in agreement.
As I took my last bite of stuffing, Gerald rotated, hopped to the edge of the table, and placed a single grape in my hand.
Then he vanished.
Everyone at the table stared.
Rowlawn sighed.
“Oh good. He’s gone to start the actual Thanksgiving.”
I looked at the grape.
Tiny handwriting crawled across its surface:
> “See you tomorrow.”
Which, knowing Gerald, was less a promise and more a warning.
