## Substrate Encoding

> Once procedures exist (001) and non-contribution is tracked (002), the system must now confront uneven contribution without collapsing into enforcement.

The potluck is the first system stress test where contribution variance is unavoidable.

## Lecture Arc

| Lecture | Encoding |
|---------|----------|
| 001 | Procedures tighten without announcement. Interpretation becomes stricter than intent. |
| 002 | Non-contribution becomes a tracked category. The Ledger notices what you didn't do. |
| **003** | **Contribution is mandatory. Inequity becomes structural. Politeness hides it.** |

## [LECTURE BEGINS]

The Committee on Non-Contributions was not founded over complaints.

It was founded over a potluck.

In 1887, the Faculty of Applied Continuity held its first Annual Contribution Luncheon. The sign-up sheet requested "one dish per attendee." Fourteen people brought napkins. Three brought "good intentions," which were logged but could not be served. One brought a dish that technically contained ingredients but resisted classification as food.

The dish was consumed anyway.

No one discussed this.

The sign-up sheet was not discarded. It was *archived*. By spring, it had developed subcategories. By the following year, it required a clerk.

The Ledger of Non-Contributions began as that sheet.

It remembers.

## On the Categories of Contribution

The Committee maintains a taxonomy. It is not punitive. It is *descriptive*.

**Category 3:** *Structural Support Without Substance.*
Napkins. Plates. The promise to "bring ice." The ice did not arrive. The promise is still on file.

**Category 7:** *Store-Bought With Packaging Removed.*
The cookies came from a tube. Everyone knows. The decorative tin is a fiction. The fiction is appreciated. The appreciation is not equivalent to contribution.

**Category 9:** *Condiment As Entrée.*
Added after the 1923 incident. A jar of mayonnaise was submitted as "a dish to share." It was not empty. It was not full. The submission was technically valid. The Committee still cannot agree on this.

**Category 11:** *Ingredients Present; Dish Absent.*
The components of food, arranged near each other. Not combined. Not prepared. Present. The Category 11 filing from 1954 contained a raw potato, a small onion, and a handwritten note that said "stew (theoretical)."

**Category 12:** *Enthusiasm Unaccompanied By Casserole.*
Ate three plates. Brought nothing. Complimented the decor. Volunteered to "help clean up" and then did not. The volunteer sheet is also archived. The archives are patient.

**Category 15:** *The Returning Dish.*
Brought something. No one touched it. Took it home. Brought it again. And again. The 1978 filing indicates a bean salad that attended eleven consecutive luncheons. It was eventually given a seat. Not out of respect. Out of seniority.

**Category 17:** *Signed Up; Did Not Appear.*
The Ledger entry is a name and a blank space.
The blank space is warm.
Not always.

## On the Participation Bowls

In 1931, the Committee began issuing Participation Bowls to all attendees.

Small. Ceramic. Glazed in a color the Department calls "grateful beige."

They are not awards. They are receipts. The bowl confirms that you were present and that something was brought. It does not confirm what. It does not confirm value. It confirms *participation*, which the Committee has determined is a separate matter from *contribution*, which is itself separate from *value*, which is not the Committee's concern.

The bowls are warm when held.

Not always.

Recipients have reported the warmth increasing when they pass the dish they brought. Recipients have reported the warmth fading when they describe what they brought. The Committee does not track these reports.

The Committee does not need to.

---

## On Equivalence

The luncheon operates on a principle of declared equivalence.

One dish is one dish. A six-hour cassoulet and a sleeve of crackers are both "one dish." The sign-up sheet does not distinguish. The Ledger does not rank. The system functions because no one is asked to compare.

Comparison is not forbidden.

It is simply not *recorded*.

This is the first system in which compliance exists but fairness fractures. Everyone contributed. Not all contributions are equivalent. No one agrees on what "counts." The luncheon continues anyway.

The word for this is *civilization*.

Or possibly *resentment*.

The Committee does not distinguish between these. Both are filed under "Ongoing."

---

## On the 1973 Entry

There is a single irregularity in the Contribution Ledger.

The 1973 luncheon contains an entry for "rotisserie, origin unclear." No attendee claimed it. No sign-up sheet recorded it. The dish was consumed before documentation could occur.

The entry includes a note, handwritten by the attending clerk:

*"Arrived warm. Departed warm. Rotation observed but not explained. Do not investigate."*

The note is initialed but not signed.

The Committee does not discuss this.

Gerald has never officially attended a potluck.

## On Continuity

The Annual Faculty Potluck continues.

The sign-up sheet circulates. The napkins arrive. The cookies are purchased and re-contained. The six-hour cassoulet sits beside the theoretical stew. The bean salad has been retired, but its seat remains.

No one is punished.

Everyone notices.

This is the mechanism.

---

*Contribution is now mandatory.*
*Inequity is now structural.*
*Politeness is the infrastructure that allows both to coexist.*

---

*The next luncheon is scheduled.*
*The sign-up sheet is already circulating.*
*Your name has been added.*

*Please indicate what you are bringing.*
*The Ledger will record whatever you write.*
*It will also record what you bring.*

*These are often different.*

*This is known.*
