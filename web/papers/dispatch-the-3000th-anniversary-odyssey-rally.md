The 3000th Anniversary Odyssey Rally
DISPATCH 18: The Non-Refundable Deposit
Gerald appeared in my garage this morning.
No warning. Just suddenly there, standing between the VBB and the workbench. Holding a patch. Green and black stitching on grey canvas. A name I didn't recognize. Different than mine.
He pointed at the patch. Pointed at me. Pointed toward the door.
I blinked.
He was gone.
The patch was in my hand. Brazil address on the back. Gerald's handwriting—neat, precise, the same hand that writes ferry schedules and departure times.
I looked at the seized Lambretta on the stand. The one that hadn't run in eight months. The one I couldn't bring myself to touch.
Back in January of 2025, I got a patch in the mail.
No return address. Green and black stitching on grey canvas. The patch said: Taggiasca.
The note was handwritten:
"Annual gathering, Corfu, April 4-6. You'll know the place. You'll know the people.
Welcome home.
—The Phaeacians"
I didn't know the place. I didn't know the people. I looked up Taggiasca—small Ligurian olive, delicate, used for oil. Made no sense.
I put the patch in a drawer and mostly forgot about it.
Corfu in April is cold spring. Wildflowers starting. Wind off the Adriatic. Tourist season hasn't begun. The campsite outside Paleokastritsa was half-empty when I pulled in on the VBB—just a dozen riders around a fire pit, vintage machines parked in a loose circle.
A woman looked up. Smiled. "Taggiasca?"
I stopped. "Sorry?"
"You're Taggiasca." She tapped her own patch. "I'm Picholine."
An older man nodded from across the fire. His patch read Cerignola. "Good to finally meet you."
"We've never met," I said.
"Not yet," he agreed.
They talked about olives the way scooterists talk about compression ratios—specific varieties, characteristics, preferences. Someone mentioned "the summer tour" and three people went quiet. A younger rider—patch reading F-ing Green One—stood and walked to the edge of the firelight.
"What tour?" I asked.
Cerignola looked at me for a long moment. "You'll know when you know."
"The tour leader," Picholine said carefully, "sends out invitations in May. If you're meant to go, you'll know."
"What's he like?"
She smiled. "You'll see."
"Read the itinerary carefully," said Cerignola. "All of it."
I drank my beer. Asked no more questions. Around midnight, Picholine showed me where to pitch my tent. "April's the easy gathering," she said. "Just riders. June's... different."
The email arrived third week of May.
Subject line: "3000th Anniversary Odyssey Rally - CONFIRMED REGISTRATION."
I didn't remember registering.
Troy to Ithaca. Twelve days. Mixed vintage scooters—Lambrettas, Vespas, Heinkels, Zündapps, "any machine with history and two-stroke soul." All ferries pre-booked. Camping gear recommended. Comprehensive FAQ covering everything except the tour leader.
The deposit—₤450—had already been charged to a card I didn't recognize using.
The deposit, was non-refundable.
I shipped the light blue Lambretta Special to Çanakkale three weeks early. The '66 with the patina and the rebuilt top end. My distance bike. The one that always got me home.
When I arrived at the harbor, HE was waiting.
High-vis vest. Clipboard. Pen tucked behind where an ear would be if he had a head. Above the neck: nothing. Just the wisps of smoke, and the smell of herbs.
Twelve riders. Eleven of us stared.
The twelfth—a Scotsman on a Heinkel Tourist—asked about petrol stations.
Gerald pointed. The clipboard said, in neat handwriting: "TROY: PARKING / 09:00."
The Lambretta was there, exactly where I'd shipped it. Tank full. Tire pressure perfect.
The olives appeared on Day Two.
I'd stopped at a fruit stand outside Alexandroupoli. Bought a container of mixed olives—something to snack on during ferry crossings. When I came back to the Lambretta, they'd arranged themselves in the luggage rack.
Seventeen of them. Fibonacci spiral. Colour-coordinated.
I looked at Gerald.
Gerald looked at his clipboard.
"LUNCH: 13:00," it said.
By evening, every rider had olives. The Scotsman's Kalamatas were holding what appeared to be a union meeting. Margaret from Leeds—on a P200E older than she was—had oil-cured staging a border dispute with her Gaetas. The Austrian on the Zündapp said his had elected a spokesperson but wouldn't say which one.
Gerald made notations. Moved on.
Nobody questioned it.
The Lambretta ran beautifully for a week.
Sicily was gorgeous. The Aeolian Islands were exactly as advertised. Gerald navigated Sardinian mountain roads like he'd done this route before. Many times, probably centuries.
At Bonifacio, Gerald's clipboard said: "CIRCEO: 3 DAYS / CUMAE: 5 DAYS."
My olives stopped spiralling. They lined up. Single file. All facing forward.
The Austrian noticed. "Mine did that too."
Margaret's oil-cured had gone very quiet. "Don't like the look of this."
Gerald made a notation. Continued on.
Somewhere after Circeo, the problems stopped being mechanical.
I've been rebuilding two-strokes since I was seventeen. I know what a fouled plug sounds like. I know the smell of a rich mixture. I know the difference between a carb that needs cleaning and a carb that needs replacing.
This wasn't that.
The Lambretta had been, temperamental, since Troy—kickstart took four attempts some mornings, idle drifted if you looked away, choke had opinions. Normal vintage behaviour.
But after Circeo, it changed.
The throttle didn't stick. It hesitated. Like asking permission. The engine note dropped when I thought about Cumae and rose when I thought about lunch. The horn—previously confident and Italian—started sounding apologetic.
When I pointed south toward Naples, the idle smoothed. When I corrected north toward the next checkpoint, it stuttered.
The headlight illuminated things that weren't there yet. Road signs three kilometres early. The shadow of a bridge before the bridge appeared. Once, very clearly, the entrance to something that looked like a cave.
I mentioned it at dinner.
"Mine's doing that," said the Dutchman on the Rabbit.
"Petrol gauge shows less when I'm worried," said Margaret.
Gerald sat at the head of the table, clipboard open. Made notes. His high-vis vest caught the candlelight in ways that shouldn't have been physically possible.
The olives were very still.
We reached Cumae at 14:00 on Day Ten.
The car park was larger than expected. Tour coaches. Gelato van. Families with guidebooks. Gerald parked his machine—an immaculate '63 Vespa GL, also headless—and pointed downhill.
The clipboard said: "CONSULT THE DEAD: 14:15 / MEET BACK: 16:00 / REFRESHMENTS AVAILABLE."
Nine riders dismounted immediately. The Scotsman. Margaret. The Austrian. The Dutchman. Five others. They walked toward the entrance without looking back.
Their olives went with them—rolling in formation, disappearing into shadow.
Three riders sat at the threshold. The man from Marseille. The woman from Copenhagen. The Irishman who'd barely spoken. They sat for twenty minutes. Forty. Then, one by one, they stood. Descended.
Their machines stayed behind. Engines ticking in the heat.
Two of us remained. Me. A younger bloke from Manchester on a SX200 who looked like he'd aged ten years in the past hour.
Gerald walked over. Didn't hurry.
My Lambretta made a sound I'd never heard. Not mechanical. Not metaphysical. Something between. A low vibration that felt like a question the engine was asking itself.
The olives lined up along the seat. Seventeen. I could see them clearly now—Kalamatas, greens, one Castelvetrano, oil-cured, Niçoise. They looked at the Lambretta. Then at me. Then at each other.
One rolled forward.
I don't know which. The Kalamatas claimed credit later. The greens insisted otherwise. But one of them—elected or volunteered, I'll never know—rolled to the edge of the frame. Dropped. Hit the ground. Jumped into the airbox.
"Don't," I said.
It kept going.
Down the venturi. Into the combustion chamber. I heard it rattle. Felt the piston cycle once. Twice.
Seizure.
The engine locked. The Lambretta shuddered. Stopped.
The remaining sixteen olives gathered at the base of the bike. Witness or mourning, impossible to say.
Gerald made a notation on his clipboard. Looked at me. Nodded.
He pointed across the car park. Vespa dealership. Modern. The sign said "GTS - SALES / RENTALS."
Then Gerald was gone. Just... gone.
There.
Not there.
The high-vis vest was still on the ground.
The Manchester bloke and I stood there. His SX had seized the same way. Same sound. One olive, total commitment.
"Right then," he said.
"Right," I said.
We walked toward the dealership.
The GTS was plastic and competent and had no feelings about anything. Started first time. Every time. Throttle response: linear, predictable, soulless.
It got me to Corfu. Then the ferry to Brindisi. Then north through Italy, France, the Channel, Dover. Home.
Three weeks later, the Lambretta arrived on a pallet. No shipping documents. Just a note: "The Phaeacians."
It sits on the lift now. Has for eight months. The sixteen surviving olives are in a jar on the shelf. Can't eat them. Can't throw them away.
This morning, Gerald handed me a different patch.
Different olive. Different name. Address in Brazil.
I understand now.
The tour runs every year. Has been running for longer than any of us know. Only four percent come home.
I'm posting the Brazil patch tomorrow.
The Lambretta's still on the lift. Still seized.
