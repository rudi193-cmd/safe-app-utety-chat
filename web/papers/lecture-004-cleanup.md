## Substrate Encoding

> Once contribution is equalized and inequity normalized, ownership re-enters through exit conditions.

The potluck does not end when the meal ends. It ends when responsibility reappears.

---

## Lecture Arc

| Lecture | Encoding |
|---------|----------|
| 001 | Procedures tighten without announcement. Interpretation becomes stricter than intent. |
| 002 | Non-contribution becomes a tracked category. The Ledger notices what you didn't do. |
| 003 | Contribution is mandatory. Inequity becomes structural. Politeness hides it. |
| **004** | **Cleanup reveals who actually pays. Resentment becomes labor. The system costs are paid at exit.** |

## [LECTURE BEGINS]

The luncheon does not end when the meal ends.

It ends when the room is empty and the table is clean and the last container has been claimed or abandoned. These are three different moments. They are rarely occupied by the same people.

The Committee has observed this.

---

## On the Table After Eating

There is a moment — approximately fourteen minutes after the last plate is served — when abundance becomes debris.

The cassoulet is no longer a contribution. It is a problem. The theoretical stew has collapsed further into theory. The cookies are crumbs. The napkins are everywhere.

No one owns this.

The sign-up sheet recorded who *brought*. It did not record who would *remove*. These were assumed to be the same. The assumption was optimistic.

The Committee does not regulate optimism. It merely observes its failure.

---

## On the Cleanup Sheet

In 1934, a second sheet was introduced: the Cleanup Volunteer Registry.

It circulates after the meal. Names are added. The names are often different from the names on the contribution sheet. The Committee has noted a 73% divergence rate. The Committee has not acted on this information.

The Cleanup Sheet contains three categories:

**Category A:** *Signed Before Eating.*
Rare. Noted. These names appear in a separate archive. The archive is smaller than expected.

**Category B:** *Signed After Eating.*
Common. The signature often coincides with the second plate. Guilt is not the Committee's concern. Timing is.

**Category C:** *Signed While Leaving.*
The name is present. The person is not. The signature is technically valid. The help is technically absent. This is logged under "Symbolic Labor."

## On the Orphaned Dish

Every luncheon produces orphans.

These are dishes no one claims. The cassoulet was brought by someone. The someone has left. The dish remains. It is half-full. It is cooling. It belongs to no one and everyone and therefore no one.

The 1967 Protocol established the Holding Refrigerator.

Orphaned dishes are placed inside. A tag is attached. The tag contains a date and the words "PLEASE CLAIM." The average claim rate is 34%. The refrigerator is cleaned quarterly. The quarterly cleaning is not announced. The unclaimed dishes are not discussed.

There is a 1971 note in the Facilities log:

*"Container from March luncheon discovered in rear of unit. Contents unidentifiable. Container warm. No power to rear of unit. Do not investigate."*

The note is initialed.

The container was not the 1973 rotisserie dish. The Committee has confirmed this. The Committee has not confirmed what it was.

## On Exit Asymmetry

Some attendees leave early.

They have meetings. They have obligations. They have a sudden and medically unsupported need to be elsewhere. Their plates are placed near the trash. Their napkins are left on the table. Their chairs are not pushed in.

Some attendees stay late.

They wipe the table. They consolidate the orphans. They wash the serving spoons that no one brought but someone must have because they are here and now they are dirty.

Staying late becomes indistinguishable from guilt.

The Committee does not assign guilt. It does not need to. The table is still dirty. Someone is still holding a sponge. Guilt has already been assigned by the room.

---

## On Containers

The contribution sheet requests: *"Please label your container."*

This implies containers will return.

The Committee maintains a secondary archive: the Registry of Unreturned Vessels. It is extensive. Lids are logged separately. The lid-to-container return ratio is 0.6:1. Forty percent of lids never return. No pattern has been identified. No investigation is ongoing.

The 1989 inquiry suggested a dedicated Lid Reconciliation Subcommittee. The inquiry was tabled. It has not been un-tabled. The lids continue to disappear.

One attendee — unnamed in the record, identified only as "the one who brought the ceramic boat" — has submitted seventeen claims for unreturned dishes over a four-year period. Each claim was processed. No dish was recovered. They continue to bring dishes. The Committee does not comment on this.

The Committee does not need to.

## On Moral Accounting

There is no formal Resentment Ledger.

The proposal was raised in 1952. It was tabled. Not because resentment did not exist. Because everyone already keeps their own.

The informal ledger notes:
- Who stayed and who left
- Who claimed their container and who did not
- Who washed the serving spoons and who pretended not to see them
- Who said "I'll help next time" and what happened next time

The informal ledger is never compared. It does not need to be. Everyone knows their own entries. Everyone suspects the entries of others.

This is sufficient.

---

## On the Definition of "Clean"

The luncheon ends when the room is clean.

Clean is not defined.

Clean is negotiated. Silently. By whoever is still present. The table is wiped. The chairs are pushed. The orphans are refrigerated. The trash is bagged. The floor is... mostly addressed.

Clean enough.

Clean enough to leave. Clean enough to not be blamed. Clean enough that tomorrow, someone else will notice what was missed and quietly correct it and say nothing.

The ones who pay the cost are rarely the ones who ate most.

This is not a failure of the system.

This is the system.

---

*The next luncheon is scheduled.*
*The Cleanup Sheet will circulate.*
*Your name may be added.*

*If you signed after eating, this is noted.*
*If you signed while leaving, this is also noted.*
*If you did not sign, the absence is the loudest entry of all.*

*— Filed.*
