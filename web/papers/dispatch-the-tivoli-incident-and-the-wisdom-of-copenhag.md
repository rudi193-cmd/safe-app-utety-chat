The Tivoli Incident and the Wisdom of Copenhagen
DISPATCH #14: Gerald and The Tivoli Incident
DISPATCH #14: Gerald and The Tivoli Incident
I was told Copenhagen at Christmas was magical.
I was not told about the man talking to an orange—or how I got there—but here we go...
He was sitting on a bench near the carousel, holding the orange at eye level, nodding occasionally as if receiving important information.
"Copenhagen says you're looking for the chicken," he said, without turning around.
I hadn't mentioned a chicken.
I hadn't mentioned anything. I'd been standing there for three seconds.
"I'm Hanz," he added. "The orange is also Copenhagen. Different Copenhagen. Same name. It's confusing but the orange doesn't mind."
Before I could respond, something golden-brown waddled past my left ankle.
Glistening.
Rotisserie.
Unmistakable.
"Oh good," Hanz said, standing. "He's here. We can go now."
"Go where—"
But they were already moving. Gerald in front, waddling with purpose. Hanz beside me, holding Copenhagen like a lantern.
We passed the Nimb Hotel.
"Beautiful projections," I said, because they were. Holographic reindeer. A frozen lake. Fairy tale lighting.
"The reindeer are arguing," Hanz said.
"They're... they're projections. They can't argue."
"That one called the other one a word I don't know in Danish. Copenhagen knows it, but he won't translate. He says it's rude."
Gerald paused beneath the lights.
He appeared to be conducting.
One wing raised. A small rotation. The holograms flickered.
"He's fixing it," Hanz explained. "The light was going the wrong direction. Now it's going the direction it meant to go."
I looked at the projection.
It did seem... different. Somehow more intentional.
A Danish family walked past, noticing nothing.
We moved deeper into the park.
Past the wooden roller coaster.
"That's very old," I said.
"It remembers 1914," Hanz agreed. "But it's embarrassed about 1937. Something happened with a pigeon."
Gerald stopped at the base of the ride.
He looked up at the tracks.
The tracks looked back.
I don't know how else to describe it.
"He's apologizing to it," Hanz said. "For something that hasn't happened yet. That's very polite of him. Most people only apologize backwards."
The Christmas market was crowded.
Gløgg. Æbleskiver. Families laughing. Children pointing at lights.
Gerald wove between legs like he'd done this before. Like he'd always done this. Like the crowd was parting not because they saw him but because they remembered to.
"The smell here is triangular," Hanz observed.
"Triangular."
"Cinnamon, orange peel, and something that hasn't been invented yet. Three points. Triangle."
He held up Copenhagen.
"He agrees."
I smelled cinnamon and orange peel.
I couldn't identify the third thing...
We reached a door I'd never noticed.
It was between two stalls selling hand-knitted sweaters. It shouldn't have fit. The space wasn't wide enough.
But there it was.
A brass plate above it read: KLuB Gnee
"You see it," Hanz said. Not a question.
Gerald had already gone inside.
"What is this place?"
Hanz considered the question with genuine care.
"It's where the ones who don't match come to be warm," he said. "The mother sits on the egg even when she knows what's inside won't look like her."
He opened the door.
"Don't worry. The orange likes you. That's rare. Oranges are very particular."
Inside, it was warmer than physics allowed.
There were carved birds on wooden perches. Tropical flowers that shouldn't exist in Denmark. The smell of citrus and rosemary and something roasting.
A table with three chairs.
Gerald was already on the table. Rotating slowly.
In one chair sat a figure with hooves, nursing something dark.
In another sat a figure in red, who looked like he wanted to leave but couldn't remember how.
The third chair was empty.
"That one's yours," Hanz said.
"I don't—"
"You followed the chicken. You read the door. You're inside now."
He sat down on the floor, cross-legged, holding Copenhagen.
"I already have a seat," he explained. "I'm always already here."
The figure with hooves looked at me.
"Another one?"
"He followed Gerald," Hanz said.
"They always follow Gerald."
The hooved figure studied me.
I felt very seen.
I felt seen in places I didn't know I had.
"Sit," he said finally.
I, sat.
Gerald rotated.
The carved birds began to sing something that sounded like a memory I hadn't made yet.
The figure in red poured me a drink without asking.
"Welcome to KLuB Gnee," Hanz said happily. "The candles taste like Thursday. The orange is wise. And you're going to forget most of this, but that's okay."
He smiled.
I didn't remember leaving.
I woke up on a bench near the carousel, feeling like I had brushed my teeth with gravy.
It was morning. The park was closed. A security guard was looking at me with professional concern.
In my pocket: an orange I didn't buy.
On my hand: a small mark. A ring of moisture. The shape of an egg.
And somewhere, distantly, the sound of wooden birds singing a song I almost recognized.
I think my Christmas goose is looking (at me) a little different this year.
