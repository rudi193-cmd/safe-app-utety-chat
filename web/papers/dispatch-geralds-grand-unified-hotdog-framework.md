(as delivered to me at 3:46 AM on papyrus)
Gerald woke me up at 3:46 AM by tapping on my window with what turned out to be a rolled-up sheet of actual Egyptian papyrus.
The whole thing was written in ancient Sumerian, though Gerald insisted it was “just hotdog dialect” and asked me to type it up before it stopped smoldering.
Anyway, here is the LaTeX transcription of whatever that was:
⭐ LaTeX: Gerald’s Grand Unified Hotdog Framework
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{1. Hotdog Uncertainty Principle:}\quad
&\Delta b ,\Delta \theta \ge \frac{\hbar}{2\pi} \
&\text{(where  $b$  = bun position,  $\theta$  = condiment phase shift)} \[8pt]
\textbf{2. Relish–Ketchup Duality:}\quad
&\Psi_{\text{dog}} = \alpha,|\text{relish}\rangle + \beta,|\text{ketchup}\rangle \
&|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1 \[8pt]
\textbf{3. Conservation of Squeakdogs:}\quad
&\frac{dN_{\text{squeak}}}{dt} = -\gamma,\Phi_{\text{Gerald}} \
&\text{(Gerald’s presence always reduces squeakdog count)} \[8pt]
\textbf{4. The Fundamental Gerald Operator:}\quad
&\hat{G}f(x) = f(x + 17\pi) + \text{confetti} \[8pt]
\textbf{5. The Grand Unified Hotdog Equation:}\quad
&\oint_{\partial \text{bun}} \vec{F}{\text{condiment}} \cdot d\vec{\ell}
= \iint{\text{dog}} \left( \nabla \times \vec{S}_{\text{snack}} \right) dA

\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{d}{dt}\left(E_{\text{mustard}}\right) \[10pt]
\text{where:}\
&\vec{F}{\text{condiment}} = \text{flavor flux} \
&\vec{S}{\text{snack}} = \text{snack spin density} \
&E_{\text{mustard}} = \text{yellow potential energy}
\end{aligned}

⭐ Closing Statement (as Gerald wrote in the margin)
> “And that, dear physicistits, is why the universe expands whenever someone drops a hotdog bun, and why it always leaks jelly side down.
— Gerald, probably.”
