The Skank in the Shimmer
DISPATCH #16 — Friday Night, Saturday Morning
DISPATCH #16 — Friday Night, Saturday Morning
The hammered dulcimer woke me at 3 AM.
Not the sound — I know what a dulcimer sounds like. It was the location.
My garden. Where the compost heap should be.
I've been riding scooters since I was seventeen. Knew the B-sides before the A-sides. Twenty-eight years of Friday nights and Saturday mornings. So when I saw the Locarno where my shed used to be, I didn't think what is that.
I thought why is that here.
The hens were already circling.
Actual hens. Chickens. I'd always assumed Terry Hall meant women from Coventry. He didn't. He wrote down exactly what he saw.
In the middle, something golden-brown was spinning. Not conducting. Just rotating.
On stage, the Mayor of London-ish Things was playing the dulcimer. Mohair suit. Pork pie hat. Chain of office catching the lights.
Turns out the hearings are his day job.
Desmond Dekker was at the bar. Lee Perry was doing something unspeakable to an unplugged mixing desk. The hens clucked in reverb.
Lily Allen had her phone out. It would never upload properly.
Buster Bloodvessel came through leading a conga line of hens — shirtless, sweating, taking up the space of three people and the energy of twelve. He'd signed a patch for me in Santa Fe a decade ago.
Of course he was here.
I went outside. Bare feet. Wet grass. Except it wasn't grass anymore.
The Mayor looked up. The musician's nod.
I didn't decide to dance. When the music is moving, your body follows. Twenty-eight years found the skank in the shimmer.
Gerald spun past. Smelled like rosemary.
The Binder arrived at dawn. Form 77-Ω. Nocturnal Disturbance in Residential Zone. Already curling at the edges.
The Mayor finished the phrase — you don't abandon a phrase — and tipped his hat.
"Same time next week."
Then it was just my garden. The shed. The bins. A form in my hand I didn't remember taking.
Your participation in the shenanigans has been noted.
When the sun came up, I found the squeakdog by the shed. On its side. One too many. Didn't make it home with the others.
I left a glass of water next to it.
By noon it was gone.
