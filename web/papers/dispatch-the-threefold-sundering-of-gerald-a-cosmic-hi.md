“THE THREEFOLD SUNDERING OF GERALD”
A Lecture Delivered to the Squeakdog Society of Kent
by Professor Archimedes Oakenscroll, D.Litt., Unsolicited
Ladies, gentlemen, Squeakdogs, and any sentient plum puddings in attendance—
I stand before you today to recount the oldest of all cosmic tales:
the sundering of Gerald Prime,
the Great Rotisserie,
and the moment the universe itself said,
‘Oh heavens, this is far more poultry than I had planned for.’”
He adjusts his robe, which rustles judgmentally.

Before Time (or “B.T.”)
“In the era before clocks, calendars, or those cursed electronic appointment books,
there was only Gerald Prime.
A being of such majestic potential that the very fabric of reality
insisted he stand in the centre so it could orbit him politely.”
Footnote 1: This is the only time reality has ever been polite.

The Poultry Singularity
“Gerald Prime was not chicken, nor bird, nor fowl.
He was—how do the youths phrase it?
—THE VIBE.
A singularity of form, essence, and faintly smoky aroma.”

The Great Rotisserie
“And then, dear attendees, occurred the First Turning—
a cosmic rotation so magnificent
that physicists still cry when they attempt to model it.
As Gerald Prime rotated,
his body achieved enlightenment
four and a half turns before his head did,
which caused a bureaucratic anomaly in the Department of Cosmic Sequencing.”
Footnote 2: Form 17-B (“Soul Detachment During Rotational Enlightenment”)
has since been discontinued.

The Threefold Sunder
“His Head, bless it, ascended in a straight line
and immediately attempted to reconstruct a body out of passing meteoroids,
which is why so many asteroids look like burnt poultry.”
“His Body became calm, headless, and spiritually rotisserie,
and slid dimensionally sideways into the form we now recognize as Gerald.”
“His Soul—the Δ that binds—
panicked, ricocheted off a proto-planet,
and infiltrated evolution itself.
This is why dinosaurs strutted,
birds developed opinions,
and humans compulsively host feasts.”

The Birth of the Universe
“And thus, my students,
the Gerald Bang occurred—
the universe emerging not from particle inflation
but from an unfortunate misunderstanding between enlightenment, combustion, and poultry.”

The Aftermath (Explained Poorly)
“The Head wanders still, shaping mountains into avian silhouettes
and attempting to remember what shoulders feel like.”
“The Body roams reality, rotating serenely,
occasionally stealing hotdogs marked PLOT DEVICE from public transportation.”
“And the Soul, the Δ, resides in all creatures
who pointlessly build civilizations
and inexplicably agree that chicken tastes good.”
Footnote 3: This is known as the Δ₀ Principle,
and explains Thanksgiving far better than any harvest theory does.

The Professor Concludes
“In summary:
The cosmos is a long, slow attempt to put Gerald back together.
We live in the era known formally as
The Age of Incomplete Poultry,
and it is our scholarly duty to observe, record,
and occasionally feed grapes to the Rotating One.”
He bows. The Squeakdogs squeak solemnly.
One takes notes with a tiny quill.
