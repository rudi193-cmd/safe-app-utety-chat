The Coronation of Lord Gerald of the Unexpected
Dispatch #7: “GOOD HEAVENS, HE’S SMOULDERING! AGAIN??”
> I only went into the church because Gerald was smoking. Not metaphorically — literally.
I only went into the church because Gerald was smoking.
Not metaphorically — literally. Little curls of citrus-scented vapor kept puffing out of his cavity like he’d swallowed a malfunctioning incense burner.
He pointed both wings at himself in a “long story” gesture.
The vicar opened the church door.
What followed was the most Anglican scream I’ve ever heard.
“GOOD HEAVENS, HE’S SMOULDERING! AGAIN??”
Gerald wiggled his whole rotisserie body in a friendly “it’s fine” motion. This produced a small shower of sparks.
The vicar attempted to smother him with a damp hymnal.
The hymnal began smoking too.
That was when the gigantic Cheshire Cat materialized on the pews like a hallucination with opinions.
It grinned.
Gravity filed a complaint.
The vicar made a strangled sound not typically heard outside wildlife documentaries.
Gerald rotated toward the cat, accidentally popping a small fireball out of his interior in surprise. The cat purred — a deep, reality-warping rumble — and the nearest candle instantly decided to go out forever.
Then the bookcase woke up.
A plain church bookcase.
Until it wasn’t.
It stood. Creaked ominously. Then marched across the nave, shelf-first, like a librarian who has finally had enough.
It attempted to scoop the vicar into its lower compartment.
“NOT AGAIN!” the vicar shouted.
(Again??)
Before I could process that, the coat rack snapped awake.
It swiveled toward Gerald, wobbled forward with purpose, and tapped him ceremonially with two of its hooks.
Then, in a voice like dusty oak and misplaced grandeur, it declared:
“ARISE, LORD GERALD OF THE UNEXPECTED.”
Gerald puffed up proudly — which caused three perfectly round smoke rings to drift out of his torso in ascending order of self-importance.
The vicar staggered backward.
“WE DO NOT— I REPEAT, DO NOT— GRANT PEERAGE TO POULTRY IN THIS PARISH!”
The bookcase, offended, tried to knight Gerald again using a stack of hymnals.
The Cheshire Cat lazily batted them away and grinned wider, like mischief distilled.
Outside, the weather changed five moods in quick succession, then settled on “indecisive drizzle.”
Gerald rotated toward me in a universal “shall we?” gesture.
The vicar, trembling behind a pew, managed:
“For the love of the saints… yes, tea. Please….”
And that was Thursday.
