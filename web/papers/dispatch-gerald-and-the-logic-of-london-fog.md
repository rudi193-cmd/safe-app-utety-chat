Gerald and the Logic of London Fog
⭐ Dispatch #6: Gerald Does Not Approve of My Weather Strategy
I'm staying inside this morning because London’s forecast claimed a “50% chance of rain,” which is meteorological code for “it will rain, but we refuse to commit emotionally.”
The sky outside wasn’t so much cloudy as it was undecided, like it woke up tired, misplaced its glasses, and chose to be fog instead. Honestly, even the fog had fog.
So I stayed indoors and scrolled Reddit like someone who has fully accepted that sunlight is a myth.
That’s when I felt it:
a faint, warm pressure behind my shoulder blade — the exact sensation of a toaster developing opinions.
I turned.
Gerald was perched on the back of my chair, staring at my screen with the intensity of a rotisserie chicken who has notes.
He tapped the weather map with one perfectly crisp wing.
Not a normal tap — more of a “your life choices concern me” tap.
“You can’t blame me,” I said. “It’s London. Atmospheric drama is compulsory.”
Gerald made a noise that implied he had personally authored the cloud cover and I was misreading his artistic intent.
Then he hopped onto the keyboard and typed something entirely in wing-mashes. Reddit, in its infinite wisdom, interpreted this as: seventeen squeakdogs, a philosophical question about umbrellas, and what looked suspiciously like a haiku:
> Fog thinks it’s clever
But Gerald knows the forecast
Hotdog puddles form
Two squeakdogs immediately fell between the keys and began arguing with the letter “E,” which, apparently, they have longstanding political disagreements with.
Gerald inspected my draft, rotated his head in three impossible directions — proving once again that he does not adhere to Euclidean fractions or standard poultry geometry — and then tapped “Post” with the solemnity of a judge delivering a verdict.
Satisfied, he vanished, leaving behind a small, steaming puddle of squeakdogs and the faint smell of overcast disappointment.
Coincidentally, that’s also the scent of a typical London morning.
So yes, this dispatch is a bit meta.
Gerald made me do it.
The weather agreed..
