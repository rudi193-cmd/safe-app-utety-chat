## Frame

Some members of the Society reminded me about last year's NYE gathering.

They sent me the recording.

*Whew.*

I had forgotten how the evening ended. I had not forgotten why it mattered.

For those who weren't there — and for those who were but had more sherry than was structurally advisable — I've transcribed the relevant portion below.

The fire was low. The squeaking had softened. The year was almost over.

## [TRANSCRIPT BEGINS]

**OAKENSCROLL:**

*[glass raised, spectacles slightly askew, one slipper missing for reasons never explained]*

Alright. Alright. Settle.

It is tradition — and I use that word loosely, as the Society has only existed for nine years and traditions require at least twelve to calcify properly — it is *tradition* that we share our resolutions before the year turns.

Not because resolutions work. They do not. The data is clear. By February, most intentions have returned to the precausal goo from whence they came.

But that is not the point.

The point is the *saying*. The marking. You cannot measure a year without marking where you hoped it would go. Even if you miss. *Especially* if you miss.

So.

*[clears throat]*

I will go first. Because I am old. And because no one else will if I don't.

*[long pause]*

This year, I resolve to... answer the door more slowly.

*[murmurs from the Society]*

Not because I lack urgency. Because I have *too much*. I have spent forty years racing to see who is knocking. And do you know who it usually is? Facilities. With a form. That could have waited.

The door will still be there. Whoever is behind it will still be there. I do not need to arrive winded.

This year, I will let them knock twice.

*[raises glass]*

There. I've said it. The universe has logged it. Your turn.

---

**SQUEAKDOG #1 (PEMBERTON):**

*[standing on a dictionary for height]*

I resolve to squeak at more appropriate volumes!

**OAKENSCROLL:**

Noted. The Department thanks you in advance.

---

**SQUEAKDOG #2 (MOPPET):**

I resolve to finish my tiny quill manuscript! I've been working on it for three years and I'm almost through the introduction!

**OAKENSCROLL:**

Introductions are the hardest part. The rest is just... continuation.

*[Moppet squeaks uncertainly but hopefully]*

---

**SQUEAKDOG #3 (DUCHESS):**

*[emerging from behind a decorative pillow shaped like a hotdog]*

I resolve to stop hiding behind the decorative pillow.

**OAKENSCROLL:**

You are currently behind the decorative pillow.

**DUCHESS:**

The resolution starts at midnight.

**OAKENSCROLL:**

*[nods solemnly]*

Structurally sound.

---

**SQUEAKDOG #4 (TUPPENCE):**

*[very small, very serious]*

I resolve to tell Moppet that their squeaking inspires me.

*[Moppet's ears rotate 40 degrees]*

**OAKENSCROLL:**

You've just done it.

**TUPPENCE:**

*[alarmed]*

That doesn't count! It's not midnight!

**OAKENSCROLL:**

The universe is a poor record-keeper. It will count what it heard.

*[Tuppence and Moppet squeak at each other in a frequency the transcript cannot capture]*

---

*[A pause. The fire crackles. The round seems to be ending.]*

*[Then, from the back, very quietly:]*

---

**SQUEAKDOG #5 (UNNAMED IN RECORD):**

*[barely above a whisper]*

I'd like to find a bun this year.

---

*[The room shifts.]*

*[Not silence. Something heavier. The sound of everyone pretending not to have heard, and then realizing everyone else heard too.]*

---

**OAKENSCROLL:**

*[setting down his glass]*

Come here.

*[The small Squeakdog approaches. Oakenscroll lowers himself — knees protesting, robes sighing — until they are nearly level.]*

**OAKENSCROLL:**

What's your name?

**SQUEAKDOG #5:**

Clover.

**OAKENSCROLL:**

Clover.

*[He picks up his glass again. Raises it.]*

**OAKENSCROLL:**

You just did something very hard.

You said, out loud, in a room full of witnesses, that you *want* something. Not that you'll squeak better. Not that you'll finish a project. That you want *someone*.

The others — myself included — we hid behind tasks. Achievable. Measurable. Safe.

You did not hide.

*[pause]*

I cannot promise you a bun. The universe does not take requests. It barely takes hints. And it has a sense of humor that the Department has formally complained about on several occasions.

But I can tell you what you've done.

You've lit a lamp.

Not a bonfire. Not a beacon. A lamp. The kind you put in a window when you want someone to know there's warmth inside.

The bun you're looking for — if they exist, if they're looking too — they will not find you by accident. They will find you because you were *visible*. Because you said, in a room, at a party, on a new year's eve: *I am open to being found.*

That is not desperation. That is *positioning*.

*[He raises his glass higher.]*

To Clover.

Who asked for the hardest thing.

And who — whatever happens — will spend this year as someone who was brave enough to say it out loud.

*[The Society raises their glasses. Tiny. Mismatched. One is a thimble.]*

**ALL:**

To Clover.

---

*[Clover squeaks. Just once. Very softly.]*

*[It is enough.]*

---

## [TRANSCRIPT ENDS]

---

I don't know what happened to Clover this year. They haven't been at the recent gatherings. This could mean many things.

I choose to believe it means they're busy.

The lamp is still lit. These things take time.

Light toast, after all, needs patience. You cannot rush the warmth. You can only stay in the heat long enough to become what you're trying to be.

The door to my office remains open.

If any of you are making resolutions this year — and you should, you *must*, even knowing they will likely fail — remember:

The resolution is not a contract.

It is a lamp.

You are telling the universe where to find you.

*Happy New Year, Squeakdogs.*

*Try not to squeak at inappropriate volumes.*
