Gerald’s Grand Unification on Damp Napkins
⭐ Gerald Claims He's Solved Grand Unification
I ran into Gerald again today.
He was standing behind the physics building in the rain, staring intently at a traffic cone while holding a stack of damp napkins covered in what he insisted were “the final equations of the Grand Unification Theorem.”
I asked him which forces he unified.
He said,
“All of them.
Gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force, the weak force,
and also the force that makes your phone fall screen-down
even though probability disagrees.”
I told him that last one isn’t a recognized interaction.
Gerald rotated slightly — the poultry equivalent of side-eye — and whispered,
“It is if you’ve lived my life.”
Before I could ask what that meant, a tiny tourist double-decker bus full of squeakdog tourists rolled past us, hit a puddle, and splashed his notes into a perfect interference pattern on the pavement.
Gerald pointed at the ripples and declared,
“There. Proof.”
I asked, “Proof of what?”
He said, “Yes.”
Then he dissolved into confetti.
Again.
