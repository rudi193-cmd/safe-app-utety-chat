The Interstate Intersection in Gloucestershire
⭐ Dispatch #8 — The I-25 Appears in Gloucestershire
The I-25 Incident (In Gloucestershire, Somehow)
I first suspected Gerald had done something when I saw the forecast.
Albuquerque and London were both scheduled to have clear skies today.
Simultaneously.
Two cities. Two continents. One weather mood.
That only happens when Gerald has been left unsupervised.
Sure enough, halfway through my walk I rounded a hedgerow in Gloucestershire and discovered a sight no Brit had ever prepared for:
Interstate 25.
Just…
cutting across the Cotswolds
like someone had dragged New Mexico through the countryside and forgotten to put it back.
Blinding road stripes, proper signage, even a “Santa Fe – North” arrow that pointed directly into a sheep field.
A tumbleweed the size of a small hatchback rolled majestically down the asphalt.
Three Englishmen stepped back, coughing.
The New Mexican chili in the air burned their throats —
they were not accustomed to weather with ingredients.
That’s when Gerald appeared beside me.
I did not bring him to England.
He just… showed up.
Glowing faintly.
Looking extremely guilty in the way only a smoking rotisserie chicken can.
He pointed a wing at the tumbleweed.
The tumbleweed stopped.
Squared itself.
And issued a dusty, rustling sound that felt suspiciously like judgment.
Then another tumbleweed arrived.
Then another.
Then dozens, forming a line straight across the interstate like a picket line of baffled, unionized vegetation.
One Englishman asked weakly,
“Is this… normal for your country?”
I said, “Not really. Ours usually move faster.”
Gerald hopped into the middle of the tumbleweed blockade, puffing authoritative citrus-steam signals like he was negotiating labor terms.
I couldn’t hear what he was saying, but the tumbleweeds seemed to understand.
They rustled.
They huddled.
They held a vote.
Finally the largest one rolled forward and whispered,
in a voice like dry paper and forgotten sagebrush:
“Tell Gerald we expect the contract by Friday.”
And just like that, they all dispersed.
I blinked.
The interstate faded.
The chile air vanished.
The sheep field returned.
Only the faint smell of red chile powder lingered in the breeze.
Gerald produced a tiny smoke ring shaped like a checkmark.
And that was Thursday.
Again.
