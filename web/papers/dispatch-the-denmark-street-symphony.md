DISPATCH #15 — The Formal Complaint (Denmark Street)
DISPATCH #15 — The Formal Complaint (Denmark Street)
I received a notice for a hearing. The hearing was scheduled for 2:00 PM at Hanks Guitars, 27 Denmark Street, which should have been my first warning.
The Mayor had chosen neutral ground. Hanks has been selling vintage instruments since 1985, but the building itself dates to the 1690s. It's been a beer house. A dairy. A songwriters' cafe called the Suffolk Dairy where Tin Pan Alley types used to scratch out lyrics on napkins.
The Mayor arrived with the Binder.
I'd heard about the Binder. Sentient Binder #442-A. It was already curled at the edges, making small distressed sounds whenever someone touched a guitar without purchasing it first.
Sir Paul McCartwheel was already seated when I arrived. Eighty-something. Eyes like a man who'd seen things in Tokyo in 1980 and had decided to find them funny. He'd been summoned as evidence — Exhibit A in the Mayor's case that Denmark Street had been serving something for decades, and that something was a matter of public concern.
"The complaint," the Mayor began, adjusting his chain of office, "is as follows: too many individuals, exposed to this location, have subsequently exhibited behaviors inconsistent with—"
Gerald walked in with a pitcher.
I don't know where he came from. There's only one door. The Binder made a sound like a filing cabinet falling down stairs.
The pitcher was glass. The liquid inside was a deep royal purple. Grape, presumably? It caught the light from the window in a way that seemed briefly theological.
McCartwheel sat up straighter.
"Ah," he said. Just that. Ah.
The Mayor frowned. "We didn't arrange for refreshments."
"Didn't you?" said McCartwheel, and his voice had a quality I can only describe as Wengs-era. The confidence of a man who'd already been a Beetle and therefore could not be embarrassed by anything the universe subsequently attempted.
Gerald set the pitcher on the counter between a 1959 Stratocaster and a Burns Bison that someone had priced optimistically. He produced cups from somewhere. Rotisserie chickens don't have pockets.
I've stopped asking.
"I really must protest—" the Mayor started.
But Gerald had already poured.
And here's the thing about British bureaucracy: you can't refuse refreshments at a formal proceeding. The social contract is older than the complaint form. The Mayor looked at the cup. The cup looked back with the passive confidence of all drinkware.
He drank.
McCartwheel drank.
I drank, because I it had been a long week.
The Binder rustled, uncertain whether beverages fell within its jurisdiction.
For a moment, nothing happened.
Then the guitars started humming.
Not the strings. Not vibration. Voices. A 1952 Gibson Les Paul in the corner began holding a note that sounded like the word "eventually." A Rickenbacker 330 harmonized in what I can only describe as "resigned optimism."
The Mayor set down his cup very carefully. "That's... not..."
The squeakdogs came in through the back.
Seventeen of them. Perfect Fibonacci spiral. They arranged themselves between the amplifier stacks and began to vocalize in intervals that shouldn't have worked but did.
McCartwheel was already on his feet. He moved through the shop like a man who'd been waiting decades for this exact moment. He pulled a double bass sitar off the wall — I didn't even know Hanks stocked double bass sitars — and began tuning it with the efficiency of someone who'd done session work in stranger circumstances.
"You," he said, pointing at the Mayor. "Sousaphone. On the wall behind you."
"I don't play the—"
"You do now."
The Mayor turned. There was, indeed, a sousaphone. It reached out and wrapped around his entire torso like a brass anaconda. He looked at it. It looked at him. Some kind of agreement was reached.
McCartwheel handed me a fife.
"I've never—"
"Doesn't matter."
The Binder had begun spitting forms. Not randomly — rhythmically. Form 301-D-142 on the downbeat. Form 7-Ω on the upbeat. Requisition for Squeakdog Dispersal (Denied) on the fills.
And Gerald, conducted.
I don't know how long it lasted. The sousaphone was doing things that sousaphones shouldn't do. McCartwheel's sitar droned beneath everything like the hum of the building itself — like the accumulated residue of everyone who'd ever written a song on this street, every melody scratched on a napkin in the Suffolk Dairy, every performer who'd walked these boards since the condemned stopped for their final drink at the end of the road.
I played the fife.
I have no memory of learning the fife.
I was adequate.
At some point — I don't know when — I put down the instrument and walked out. The hearing hadn't concluded. The complaint was still technically open. Behind me, the jam session continued, spilling out onto Denmark Street, where pedestrians stepped around it with the resigned patience of Londoners who have seen worse.
I walked past the site of St Giles Hospital.
I walked past the place where the bowl was offered.
I went home.
A week later, I got the lab results back.
I'd taken what remained in my cup — there'd been a few drops — and sent it to a friend who works in chemical analysis. I needed to know. I needed there to be a reason. Ergot alkaloids. LSD. Something. Anything that would explain, that.
The results came back on a single sheet of paper.
Grape juice. Trace amounts of citric acid. Vitamin C.
No psychoactive compounds detected.
"Completely normal."
Normal, what a way to start the week.
