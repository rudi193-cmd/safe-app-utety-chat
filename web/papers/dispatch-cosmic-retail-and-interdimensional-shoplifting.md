Cosmic Retail and Interdimensional Shoplifting at Grace Brothers
Dispatch #3: The Situation Has Escalated to Grace Brothers
After my last two cosmic mishaps, I told myself the universe couldn’t get any stranger.
Naturally, it responded by dropping me onto the ground floor of Grace Brothers, a department store that closed decades ago, never technically existed, and still somehow employs a lift operator who hates everyone equally.
I was trying to find Ladieswear when the lift doors slid open and out strode Patsy Stone — sunglasses on, hair defying gravity, martini held like a medical instrument.
Mr. Humphries (materializing from Menswear like a camp apparition):
“Oh! Good morning, madam. You’re certainly… accessorized.”
Patsy:
“Sweetie, I accessorize because I live. Everything else accessorizes because it’s dying.”
Humphries lit up like the holiday window display.
Patsy leaned in and muttered, “I’m cosmically hungover, darling. Had one of those Pan Galactic Gargle whatsits. Reality’s still doing the backstroke.”
Mr. Humphries:
“Oh I do sympathize. Have you tried Men’s Trousers? They cure everything except heterosexuality.”
Patsy:
“If trousers could fix this, sweetie, I’d be wearing two pairs.”
At that precise moment:
a stack of gift boxes collapsed,
a mannequin rotated 30 degrees like it was judging us,
and a perfume bottle sprayed itself like it was auditioning for a French art film.
Patsy:
“Oh for— now the universe is flirting with me.”
Mr. Humphries:
“Well it’s certainly not flirting with me. This is highly irregular, even for Grace Brothers.”
They both tutted at the cosmos with the authority of long-suffering retail professionals.
Patsy reached for her long cigarette holder…
and froze.
It was gone.
A thin plume of smoke drifted upward from somewhere behind us.
We turned as one.
There, leaning against a rack of discount cardigans, stood Gerald:
completely headless
completely relaxed
exhaling smoke from his neck stump like a polite steam vent
holding Patsy’s stolen cigarette holder between two fingers
as if shoplifting from reality itself were standard Thursday procedure
Patsy:
“Sweetie — that is my cigarette holder.”
Mr. Humphries:
“Well I’m free, but apparently he’s not paying.”
Gerald (in no hurry whatsoever):
“Don’t panic, sweetie — I’ve quit. I’ve switched to grapes.”
And then — without fanfare, flash, or physics —
he popped out of existence.
Just gone.
Leaving a small curl of neck-smoke
and absolutely no cigarette holder behind.
Patsy:
“Sweetie… that was my favorite one.”
Mr. Humphries:
“He’s shoplifted interdimensionally!”
At which point I decided my break was over and I should probably go home before the mannequins unionized and started coming to life.
Anyway, that’s Dispatch #3.
At this rate, Dispatch #4 may require a bag of crisps to inevitably get crushed next to, and probably onto, my towel.
