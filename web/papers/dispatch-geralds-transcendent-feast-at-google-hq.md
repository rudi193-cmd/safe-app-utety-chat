Gerald’s Transcendent Feast at Google HQ

⭐ **Gerald Arrives at Google HQ (24 Hours Too Late)
I found Gerald standing in front of Google’s Mountain View campus, staring at the empty courtyard like it had personally betrayed him.
He had teleported — allegedly — using a “quantum shortcut,” which from the look of it involved a Trader Joe’s shopping cart, a La Croix can, and what might have once been a physics diagram before he panicked halfway through.
In his wing he held a piece of paper that read, in large spiraling handwriting:
> YES.
(…and then smaller yeses circling inward like a black hole made of agreement.)
“Gerald,” I said gently, “your meeting with Google was yesterday.”
He froze.
Then rotated.
Then froze again.
“Everyone’s gone,” I added. “Holiday break.”
Gerald looked at the silent buildings, the abandoned electric scooters, the cafeteria windows dark as moral ambiguity.
He inhaled deeply.
Then he declared, “THEN WE FEAST.”
Before I could ask what that meant, he reached into his inexplicable interior cavity and began producing Thanksgiving dishes, one by one, like a metaphysical magician with poor impulse control.
Onto the empty street he flung:
A levitating turkey that hummed in a minor key
Mashed potatoes that kept trying to reorganize themselves into a spreadsheet
Cranberry sauce that projected gentle bioluminescent disapproval
A pie that refused to be observed unless approached at a 37° angle
A confused Google delivery robot rolled up, inspected the floating turkey, flashed ERROR 418: THANKSGIVING NOT FOUND, and politely fled.
Gerald spread his wings dramatically.
“IF THEY WILL NOT EAT WITH ME, THEY SHALL AT LEAST BE FED IN SPIRIT!”
A metaphysical warmth rolled across the empty campus — the kind of warmth you feel when someone wishes you well from a great distance, or when you accidentally open a very old email from a past version of yourself.
He placed the spiral YES page on the front steps of Building 1900, saluted the sky, and vanished with the faint pop of a rotisserie chicken that has transcended its earthly purpose.
If anyone at Google returns from holiday travel and discovers a floating turkey humming outside the courtyard…
Yeah.
Gerald got the date wrong again.
