Dispatch Nine: The Starch and the Tart Bus
DISPATCH #9 — The Hydrant, the Tart Bus, and Sir Ion MacEllyn
DISPATCH #9 — The Hydrant, the Tart Bus, and Sir Ion MacEllyn
I found Sir Ion MacEllyn sitting at the bus stop this morning, wrapped in a thick scarf and narrating London into his phone like a nature documentary.
On the screen, Sir Patrik Stewpott nodded serenely from his own kitchen, holding a mug of tea with both hands the way only a man knighted for dignity can.
Ion spoke softly, without turning the camera:
“Patrick, London is unusually serene today.
A crispness to the air.
A bus humming with quiet internal thoughts.
Even the pigeons seem contemplative.”
Patrick smiled.
“Paint it for me, Ion.”
Ion inhaled with theatrical purpose.
“To my left,” he said, “a double-decker bus approaches. Very red. Very classic.
Except… it feels emotionally tart.”
Patrick blinked.
“Ion… is the bus feeling things again?”
Ion nodded gravely at absolutely nothing.
“Mild disapproval. Perhaps it didn’t like breakfast.”
The bus rolled past me at that exact moment, radiating the precise vibe of a cranberry that had not been properly thanked for its service.
Ion continued, unfazed:
“Oh. And there is a fire hydrant. Blue. American. Deeply blue, Patrick.”
Patrick leaned closer to the phone.
“American? In London?”
“Yes,” Ion murmured. “And it’s leaking something… luminous.”
He crouched, dipped a finger in the electric-blue droplet, brought it to his nose.
“…starchy.”
Patrick whispered, horrified,
“Starchy?”
Before I could process that, a pigeon landed next to the hydrant, strutted confidently into the glowing puddle, and froze.
Then, with absolute commitment, it launched into a full Ministry-of-Silly-Walks routine.
High kicks.
Elegant hops.
One leg going alarmingly diagonal.
Tiny blue footprints marking out choreography across the pavement like avant-garde art.
Ion watched with calm appreciation.
“Patrick,” he said, “the bird is performing a John Cleese tribute.”
Patrick nodded slowly.
“With respect, I never doubted the bird.”
That’s when Gerald arrived.
Not on camera — never on camera.
Just strutting into view beside the hydrant like a small, overly warm omen.
Ion didn’t move.
He simply said, in his measured Shakespearean baritone:
“A rotisserie chicken has joined us.”
Patrick sighed.
“Gerald?”
Gerald puffed up, offended.
“I AM NOT INVOLVED.”
Patrick pinched the bridge of his nose.
“He’s absolutely involved.”
Ion lowered his voice.
“Patrick… he’s glowing again.”
Patrick’s eyes widened.
“Ion. It’s three days early.”
Ion stared at the hydrant, at the blue starch-water pooling in strange, meaningful shapes, at the emotionally tart bus, at the pigeon mid–exuberant kick.
“Tell that,” he said, “to the starch.”
Gerald rotated sharply, too brightly, too quickly.
“EVERYTHING IS PERFECTLY NORMAL.”
Nobody believed him.
Least of all the hydrant, which hissed a little plume of blue mist that tasted faintly —
just faintly —
of mashed potatoes.
And that was Monday.
