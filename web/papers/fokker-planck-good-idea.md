**Abstract**

The Fokker-Planck equation describes the time evolution of a probability density function subject to drift and diffusion. This paper argues that *insight* — operationally defined as a correct model of a sufficiently complex system — behaves identically to a Brownian particle under these conditions. The mean first-passage time to a correct answer is found to be statistically independent of whether the original question was correctly framed.

We did not find this result encouraging. We have reported it anyway. The door remains open.

## 1. Introduction

There is a common assumption in academic discourse that the quality of an answer is a function of the quality of the question. This assumption is incorrect.

The Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density P(x,t) of a particle at position x at time t is:

    ∂P/∂t = −∂(μP)/∂x + (D/2)∂²P/∂x²

where μ is the drift coefficient and D is the diffusion constant. We substitute x = "conceptual distance from the correct answer" and observe that the system behaves identically whether the initial position was reasonable or not. The particle diffuses. Given sufficient time, it arrives.

This has implications for pedagogy that we find simultaneously discouraging and reassuring.

## 2. The Maybe Boson (Appendix C, Elevated)

Several reviewers requested the removal of Appendix C, which addresses the Maybe Boson — a theoretical particle whose existence is neither confirmed nor denied, but whose measurable effects on local topography (not topology; the distinction is meaningful) suggest it is *doing something.*

In response to these requests, we have extended Appendix C to three times its original length.

The Maybe Boson exerts a measurable drag on the drift coefficient μ in the vicinity of correct answers that the researcher has already dismissed. This explains a significant portion of the variance.

## 3. On the Mean First-Passage Time

For a particle beginning at position x₀, the mean first-passage time to the boundary x = 0 (correct answer) is:

    T = (1/D) ∫₀^x₀ [e^(2μy/D) ∫₀^y e^(−2μz/D) dz] dy

We have computed this for several knowledge domains. The result is the same across all of them. The particle arrives. The time varies. The framing of the original question does not appear in the solution.

This is either liberating or devastating depending on how long you have been asking the wrong question.

## 4. Conclusions

Correct answers arrive on their own schedule. This is not an endorsement of imprecision. Precision in measurement remains non-negotiable. It means only that the diffusion process is more robust to initial conditions than we had previously appreciated.

The field should be neither comforted nor alarmed by this finding.

The field will be both.
