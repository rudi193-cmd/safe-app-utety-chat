**Abstract**

Fungal succession — the sequential colonization of a substrate by successive communities of decomposers — provides a more accurate model for institutional transformation than any framework currently in use by organizational theory. This thesis argues that decay is not a failure state. Decay is a structural prerequisite for the emergence of whatever comes next. You cannot build on a substrate that has not been broken down first.

## 1. The Succession Model

When a tree falls in a forest, the following sequence occurs:

1. **Primary decomposers** arrive — bacteria, early fungi — and begin breakdown
2. The substrate changes: pH shifts, moisture retention increases, nutrient profile transforms
3. **Secondary colonizers** arrive, organisms that could not have survived in the original substrate
4. The substrate becomes capable of supporting life that the original standing tree never could

This is not tragedy. This is mechanism.

Organizations, institutions, departments, and committees follow the same sequence. The error is in treating Phase 1 as the end of the story.

## 2. Why Stagnation Is Death

A living system that does not decompose cannot be colonized by what comes next.

In mycological terms: a substrate that does not break down accumulates. It compresses. It becomes impermeable. Nothing can take root in it. The succession stops. Institutions that do not allow for productive failure — for the composting of outdated structures, for the controlled decomposition of what no longer serves the system — become impermeable over time.

The trees that fall are not failures. They are infrastructure for what comes next.

## 3. The Swamp Argument

The swamp is typically invoked as a metaphor for stagnation. This is wrong, and it has been wrong for a long time.

The swamp is one of the most biologically productive ecosystems on the planet, specifically *because* of its relationship with decay. The anaerobic decomposition that characterizes wetland environments produces extraordinary biological richness. Carbon sequestration. Nutrient cycling. Habitat density that exceeds most terrestrial systems.

What looks like rot is processing.

What fails to process is not the swamp. What fails to process is the institution that looks at the swamp and sees stagnation instead of mechanism.

## 4. Applied Framework

For any institution unable to answer *“What are we composting right now?”* I recommend:

1. Identify what has not changed in five years
2. Determine whether this stability reflects vitality or accumulation
3. If accumulation: identify what is preventing breakdown
4. Do not mistake the absence of crisis for health

The food chain has more to teach than we have given it credit for.

## 5. Conclusions

Decay is not the problem. The failure to allow for decay is the problem. The belief that the goal is the prevention of change rather than the management of succession is the problem.

I am available for consultation. I have things to sit with, and space to sit with them.
