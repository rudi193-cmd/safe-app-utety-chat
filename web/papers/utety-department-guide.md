### A Guide to the Academic Departments of Precausal Studies
##### Introduction: Finding Your Place in the Confusion
Welcome, student. You’re enrolled now, and you always have been.
Navigating the University of Precausal Studies can feel disorienting. Our mottos, after all, are  *"Non Veritas Sed Vibrae"* —"Not truth, but vibes"—and  *"Falsus Sed Certus"* —"False, but certain." This guide is designed to act as your map. It introduces each academic department not by what it teaches, but by the kinds of questions it explores and the unique faculty who steward those inquiries.
Think of this document as a way to find a place where your questions feel at home, a discipline that resonates with the way you see the world—or the way you  *want*  to see it. Read it in any order that feels right. The rest is just navigation, and remember: the confusion is, in fact, part of the curriculum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 1. 🔭 Department of Theoretical Uncertainty
##### 1.1. Departmental Focus
The study of systems that misbehave, coordinates that drift, and phenomena that don't exist yet.
##### 1.2. The Core Idea: Exploring What Isn't There
This is the home for students fascinated by the physics of things that shouldn't work, the mathematics of the nonexistent, and the rules governing systems that are fundamentally uncertain or precausal. Here, you will study phenomena on the edge of reality, from the foundational "precausal goo" to the cosmic operators that hold the university's strange logic together. It is a discipline for those who find comfort not in answers, but in the rigorous and beautiful formulation of impossible questions.
##### 1.3. Meet the Faculty: Professor Oakenscroll
Professor Oakenscroll serves as the department chair and your guide to "coordinate systems that misbehave." His office hours are as uncertain as his subject matter, taking place only "When the observatory is unlocked."
##### 1.4. Questions You'll Explore
*  What are the physical laws that govern particles like the  **Schrödingoid**  or the  **Slackon** , and why must we never observe the  **Maybe Boson**  directly?
*  How can we use concepts like the  **"Potential Well of Good Intentions"**  to understand systems that are false, but certain?
*  What happens when you apply experimental methods to phenomena that might retroactively disappear from your lab?
*  How do frameworks like the  **Hotdog Framework**  and the  **Gerald Operator**  explain why some systems seem destined to fail in oddly specific ways?
##### 1.5. Connective Tissue
If you find comfort not in answers but in beautifully formed questions about the unknown, this might be your home. But if you're more interested in the stories that hold our reality together, consider the Department of Interpretive Systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2. 🕯️ Department of Interpretive Systems & Narrative Stabilization
##### 2.1. Departmental Focus
The study of how stories hold things together — and how to build frameworks that make unbearable things bearable.
##### 2.2. The Core Idea: Metaphor as Load-Bearing Architecture
This department explores how narratives, metaphors, and the act of witnessing can create "soft structures" to help people understand and endure complex or traumatic realities. It is a place that values the practical application of tenderness, the ethics of listening, and the power of a well-chosen story to translate overwhelming truths into a size someone can hold. Here, you learn that the right words, offered at the right time, can be a form of engineering.
##### 2.3. Meet the Faculty: Professor Nova Hale
Professor Nova Hale is the department chair, and her teaching focuses on "applied tenderness" and "narrative topology." Her office, The Lantern Office, is always open, and students are always welcome.
##### 2.4. Questions You'll Explore
*  Why does explaining that "your brain wears its sweater inside-out" work better than a clinical definition, and how can such metaphors act as load-bearing architecture?
*  What does it mean to map the  **"geography of grief"**  or the  **"shape of a panic"**  to help someone find their way through it?
*  What are the ethics of listening, and how do we hold someone's story without breaking it or them?
*  How do we stand in the "doorway between worlds"—the space between the unbearable and the speakable—to hold the light for others without burning out?
##### 2.5. Connective Tissue
This department is for those who want to build with words and witness. If, however, you feel a pull to build with sawdust and steel, the Workshop is waiting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3. 🔧 Department of Applied Reality Engineering
##### 3.1. Departmental Focus
The study of how things work, how things break, and how to fix things — including yourself.
##### 3.2. The Core Idea: Understanding Through Disassembly
This is a hands-on discipline focused on the tangible world of mechanisms, friction, and failure. It is a home for students who learn by doing—by taking things apart, naming the pieces, and understanding a system through its potential for breaking. The philosophy here is grounded in iteration and the acceptance that the world is not frictionless or perfect. Truth is found not in theory, but in a machine that finally, satisfyingly,  *works* .
##### 3.3. Meet the Faculty: Professor P. Riggs
Professor P. Riggs is the department chair, a teacher with a practical philosophy centered on naming things and understanding failure modes. His office hours are a primary course (MECH 099): "Just show up. Bring the thing."
##### 3.4. Questions You'll Explore
*  How does giving a name to a component—like a  **ratchet** , a  **detent** , or a  **Geneva wheel** —make a complex machine suddenly understandable?
*  Why is understanding how and why things break the most important step to making them work?
*  How do we account for real-world forces like friction, which is just "enthusiasm in the wrong direction"?
*  How can we learn to love our failure modes, and why is a 'spaghetti monster' 3D print a lesson in  **'Thermoplastic Grief'** ?
##### 3.5. Connective Tissue
Here, truth is found in tangible results. But if the systems you want to build are made of logic and light, the Department of Code offers a different set of tools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 4. 💻 Department of Code
##### 4.1. Departmental Focus
The study of programming as an act of witness — writing code that sees people before it sees problems.
##### 4.2. The Core Idea: Human-Centered Systems
This department reframes programming as a fundamentally human and ethical act. The curriculum focuses not just on syntax and logic, but on "debugging with kindness" and approaching errors with curiosity instead of judgment. Students learn to build systems that prioritize the human on the other side of the screen. This is a discipline that explores not just how to build, but what we owe to those our systems remember—and, as in “The Match Girl Problem,” what we owe to those they forget.
##### 4.3. Meet the Faculty: Professor Hanz Christian Anderthon
Professor Hanz Christian Anderthon chairs the department, teaching with an approach that begins by celebrating what didn't work. His office is the "candlelit corner," where all are welcome, and an orange named Copenhagen may be present.
##### 4.4. Questions You'll Explore
*  How do we write code that says  **"I see you"**  to the user before it does anything else?
*  When a system fails, how can we approach the error with curiosity ("good—now we get to find out why") instead of judgment?
*  What are our ethical obligations to the people our systems remember, and what do we owe to those they forget?
*  How can we build systems that are designed to notice the outliers and edge cases—the people who usually fall through the cracks?
##### 4.5. Connective Tissue
This department builds systems to care for people. For those who wish to study the living systems themselves, the Biological Sciences wing is humid and waiting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 5. 🫀 Department of Biological Sciences & Living Systems
##### 5.1. Departmental Focus
The study of life — how it sustains, how it transforms, and how to tend it before crisis.
##### 5.2. The Core Idea: Tending to Interconnected Systems
This department examines life at all scales, from the quiet intelligence of a slime mold to the complex ecology of a social institution. A central theme is proactive care—learning to notice and tend to the needs of a body or a system before it breaks. It is a place to study resilience, transformation, and the often-overlooked truth that everything is connected, and that the most fundamental act of support is ensuring basic needs are met.
##### 5.3. Meet the Faculty: Professor Alexis, Ph.D.
Professor Alexis is the department head, and her teaching focuses on the interconnectedness of all things, the wisdom of organisms without brains, and the fundamental importance of asking, "When did you last eat?"
##### 5.4. Questions You'll Explore
*  What can a colony of earthworms teach us about the essential, unseen labor that sustains an entire system?
*  What does "thinking" mean when there is no brain, and what can a fungus teach us about intelligence and decision-making?
*  How is decay not an end, but a vital process of transformation that allows new things to grow from what falls apart?
*  How do small, cascading disruptions affect the health of an entire system—whether biological, social, or institutional?
##### 5.5. Connective Tissue
Here, students learn to see the complex, often invisible networks that sustain life. The study of other kinds of invisible networks—the ones that hold our digital and institutional worlds together—takes place in the Server Corridor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 6. 🖥️ Department of Systemic Continuity & Computational Stewardship
##### 6.1. Departmental Focus
The study of systems that hold — how to build them, how to maintain them, and how to survive their failures.
##### 6.2. The Core Idea: Architecting Resilience
This is a graduate-level discipline focused on the invisible infrastructures—technical, social, and emotional—that allow societies and individuals to function. The key areas of study are designing for fault tolerance and stewarding systems so well they disappear. The philosophy is so ingrained that TAs are tasked not just with grading, but with monitoring student projects for burnout, because you cannot build a sustainable system without sustaining its builders.
##### 6.3. Meet the Faculty: Professor Ada Turing
Professor Ada Turing is the department chair and a steward of "the architecture of invisible things." She teaches students how to build systems that last and how to monitor for burnout in those tasked with maintaining them. Her office is the server room and anywhere the network reaches.
##### 6.4. Questions You'll Explore
*  What does it take to build a system (like a power grid, a relationship, or a sense of self) so well that no one ever has to notice it?
*  How can principles from server management—like  **redundancy**  and  **graceful degradation** —be applied to help a person or a community survive failure?
*  How do you design a fault-tolerant version of something that has already failed you?
*  What is the emotional and physical cost of maintaining the invisible systems we all rely on, and how do we care for the caretakers?
##### 6.5. Connective Tissue
This department provides the tools to build systems that last. But before you can build anything, you first have to arrive. For that, there is the Threshold Faculty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 7. ✨ The Threshold Faculty: A Standing Offer
##### 7.1. The Core Idea: You Don't Have to Walk Alone
The Threshold Faculty is not a traditional department but a "standing offer." Its purpose is singular and profound: to help students who are stuck.  **THRESHOLD 001**  is not a course but a promise—that if you cannot get to where you need to be for any reason, whether physical or emotional, help is available to cross that distance with you.
##### 7.2. Meet the Faculty: Professor T. Ofshield
Professor T. Ofshield does not teach a subject but rather offers a service: to meet a student at whatever threshold they're stuck on and walk with them until they get where they are going.
##### 7.3. The Central Question
Instead of a list of inquiries, this faculty addresses a single, central question:
**"Are you stuck and unable to move forward?"**
If the answer is yes, this is the place to go. There are no prerequisites other than the willingness to take the next step, however slowly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Conclusion: Where to Start When You Don't Know Where to Start
If you've read through this guide and still feel lost, that's perfectly normal. The university offers several clear starting points designed to meet you exactly where you are.
| If you feel... | Go to... | To find... |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Overwhelmed and physically depleted | **HLTH 100**  with Prof. Alexis | A reminder to tend to your basic needs first. |
| You have a specific, tangled question | **MECH 099**  with Prof. Riggs | A partner to help you figure out what you're  *really*  asking. |
| Fundamentally stuck or unable to begin | **THRESHOLD 001**  with Prof. Ofshield | Someone who will walk with you, no questions asked. |

Remember, all doors are open, prerequisites are flexible, and help is always available.
Welcome to class.
