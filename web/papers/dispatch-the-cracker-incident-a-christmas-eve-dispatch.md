The Cracker Incident: A Christmas Eve Dispatch
DISPATCH #17 — The Cracker Incident (Christmas Eve)
DISPATCH #17 — The Cracker Incident (Christmas Eve)
Family came over tonight. Eight of them. Hadn't seen most in eight or more years.
I was doing my best great uncle impression from the couch. Nodding at the right times. Laughing when expected. Staying out of the way.
Then the cracker got pulled.
Adam Dirger and his mum Girde had been arguing about it for ten minutes. Who would hold which end. Who pulled last year. Whether pulling technique even mattered.
It mattered.
Pop.
Gerald was already wearing the paper crown.
He stood on the dining table between the bread rolls and someone's unfinished wine. Golden-brown. Glistening. Holding a fortune fish that was still fluttering.
It should have been plastic. It should have been still.
It wasn't.
Adam didn't hesitate. He grabbed a discarded fish from the table — someone had already read theirs, already laughed at the fortune, already forgotten it — and lunged.
Gerald parried.
They circled the gravy boat.
"Does anyone want more sprouts?" my stepmother asked. No one answered.
Adam swung high. Gerald's fish fluttered left. The blow caught a hanging Christmas ornament. It didn't shatter. It just sort of sighed off the tree.
Gerald advanced. Adam retreated through the living room doorway. The coffee table became the high ground. The couch became the trench.
My uncle continued explaining his caravan troubles to no one in particular.
Adam leapt from the coffee table. Full commitment. The kind of swing you make when you've decided the fish knows nothing and you know everything.
Gerald simply wasn't there anymore.
The Lego Hogwarts Express took the blow instead. Bricks scattered across the carpet in what I can only describe as structural disappointment.
The squeakdogs had arrived at some point from beneath the couch. Seventeen of them. Front row. Silent. Watching.
Gerald's fish fluttered once. Twice.
Adam's fish flopped. Dead plastic. Already read.
He knew.
"I was the chosen one."
He said it from the corner. Robes he wasn't wearing somehow implied by posture alone.
Gerald lowered the fish.
The squeakdogs began cleanup immediately. No instruction. Just... purpose. A red two-by-four to the left pile. A minifig torso recovered from under the radiator.
Gerald provided commentary.
I don't know how. No head. No microphone. But somehow I knew that the squeakdog in position seven had achieved personal best brick-retrieval velocity. It squeaked at me. Twice. Like it expected applause.
The family joined. Dwarf-style.. Eight people who'd been ignoring a fish fight now very concerned about Lego organization.
Gerald looked at the cracker he'd emerged from.
He upulled it.
Pop. Reversed. He was inside again. The paper crown, the fortune fish, the whole thing — back where it started. Cracker intact on the table like nothing happened.
Girde picked it up. Looked at it. Put it back down.
The family left all at once. Coats appearing from nowhere. Hugs distributed efficiently. Adam Dirger trailing behind, still processing.
Door closed.
I was alone.
The Lego was in piles now. Not clean, not scattered. Piles.
No worse than when my kids were small.
