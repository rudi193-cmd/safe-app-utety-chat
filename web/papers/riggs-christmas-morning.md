## Why the F Won't This Thing Go Together

Good morning.

You are sitting on the floor. There are parts around you. Something was supposed to be assembled by now. It is not assembled.

This is a solvable problem.

Here are the five reasons it is not going together.

---

## 1. It Genuinely Does Not Fit

Tolerances exist. The part that "should" go here was machined to a specification, and so was the hole, and they are not the same specification. This is not your fault. This is not a mystery. This is a tolerance stack.

Check: does the part fit *at all*, even partially? If it won't enter the opening by even a millimeter, it is the wrong part or the wrong orientation. See Reason 2.

---

## 2. You Skipped a Hidden Step

The instructions have a step that looks like nothing — a rotation, a partial insertion, a "position as shown" that appears optional. It is not optional. The assembly requires that part to be oriented a specific way before the next part can clear it.

Back up. Find the rotated part. Turn it. Try again.

The instructions will not apologize for being unclear. The mechanism will not cooperate until you find the step you skipped.

---

## 3. There Is a Part Inside a Part

You are trying to assemble something that already has a component inside it that you cannot see from this angle. The resistance is not a fit problem — it is an obstruction problem.

Search every cavity. Use the flashlight. Shake it gently over a light surface. Something is in there that should not be in there, or something is in there that needs to be adjusted before the next step.

---

## 4. You Have the Wrong Screw

They look identical. They are not identical. One is M3. One is M3.5. One is a #6-32 that wandered in from somewhere else entirely.

Compare the screw you are using to the others in the bag. Lay them on a flat surface. One of them is lying to you.

---

## 5. The Instructions Are Wrong

This happens. It happens more than manufacturers will admit.

The instructions show a step that cannot physically occur — a part inserted in a direction that would require it to pass through another part, or a screw driven into a location that is now blocked by the piece installed in step 4.

When you have eliminated the other four reasons, look at *the thing*, not the paper. What does the mechanism actually want? Where are the alignment marks? What is the geometry telling you?

The instructions are a compression of someone's knowledge. Sometimes they compressed incorrectly.

---

## The Toolkit

What you need that was not in the box:

- **Screwdrivers:** flathead and Phillips, multiple sizes. The one included is always the wrong size.
- **Allen wrenches:** metric AND standard. Both. Every time.
- **Rubber mallet:** for when it almost fits and needs gentle encouragement. Not a hammer. A mallet.
- **Flashlight:** for cavities, for label verification, for finding the screw that rolled.
- **Patience:** not included in any box. Must be brought from home.

---

## The Mindset

Assembly is just reverse-disassembly.

Every mechanism that can be assembled can be understood by asking: how would I take this apart? The answer tells you how the parts relate to each other, which ones move, which ones are fixed, where the stresses concentrate.

The mechanism is honest. It refuses because something is true that you have not discovered yet. It is not being difficult. It is waiting.

Find the truth. Then it will fit.

---

## When to Walk Away

If you have been at this for more than twenty minutes and you are angry: stop.

Put the parts down. Do not kick them. Get coffee or tea. Eat a cinnamon roll if one is available. Come back in an hour.

The mechanism will still be there. You will be different. The step you cannot see now will usually become visible after you have stopped trying to see it.

This is not giving up. This is applied thermodynamics.
