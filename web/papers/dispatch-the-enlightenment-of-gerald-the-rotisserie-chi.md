The Enlightenment of Gerald the Rotisserie Chicken
A ridiculous story that I thought Douglas Adams fans would enjoy, bring a towel.
Somewhere, in a forgotten aisle of a discount supermarket that only exists on Thursdays,
there is a sentient rotisserie chicken named Gerald who has achieved complete enlightenment.
Not because of meditation.
Not because of stillness.
But because he has been spinning under a heat lamp for seven consecutive presidential administrations, and the centrifugal force has aligned all his chakras purely by accident.
Gerald has two mortal enemies:

A pineapple who is convinced it’s a freelance tax auditor
A mop who has been emotionally devastated ever since it realized its wet floor signs are lying — because the floor is NEVER actually “slippery when wet.” It’s always slippery. Wetness is not the issue. The mop feels betrayed.
Anyway.
One day Gerald (the enlightened rotisserie chicken) comes to understand that his life’s true purpose is to sue the sun.
For copyright infringement.
Because, as he calmly explains in a 47-page handwritten legal complaint (written with a crayon he sharpened using only the power of regret),
“The sun has been rotating without my permission.”
The judge — who is a retired stapler — takes the case very seriously.
Meanwhile, the pineapple tax auditor bursts into the courtroom screaming:
> “THE CHICKEN ISN’T EVEN EMPLOYED HERE, YOUR HONOR!
HE’S A SIDE DISH WITH DELUSIONS OF LUMINOSITY!”
The stapler bangs itself against the desk to demand order, but accidentally staples the mop to a copy of Better Homes & Gardens, which the mop interprets as a marriage proposal.
The mop begins sobbing uncontrollably.
Gerald gently rolls off the rotisserie spit (still glowing with spiritual authority) and says:
> “Mop… you deserve someone who won’t fold under pressure.”
The mop weeps harder because it doesn’t understand the pun.
The pineapple is now furious, because puns are the only language it respects.
It points dramatically at the chicken and shouts:
> “HE’S UNDERCOOKED ON THE INSIDE AND OVERCOOKED ON THE SOUL!”
Then — in a completely unprompted twist —
the ceiling tiles descend like featherless angels and begin chanting:
> “SPIN! SPIN! SPIN!
RETURN TO THE LAMP, CHICKEN BOY!”
And Gerald, saintlike, ascends through the tiles…
not to heaven…
but to the store’s intercom system, where he spends the rest of his days whispering inspirational messages like:
> “Attention shoppers…
love yourself…
aisle seven has discounted pudding…
and the pineapple is lying to you.”
