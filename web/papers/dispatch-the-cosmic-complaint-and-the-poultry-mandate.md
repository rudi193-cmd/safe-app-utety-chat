The Cosmic Complaint and the Poultry Mandate
Dispatch 9B-S½ — The Cosmic Complaint Form
Dispatch 9B-S½ — The Cosmic Complaint Form
It began, as these things often do, with a Moderator having a small emotional crisis.
One moment I was minding my own business, posting a perfectly normal interdimensional update about a rotisserie chicken who rearranges holidays for fun.
The next moment, a mod somewhere—possibly wearing pajamas, possibly trembling with civic indignation—declared my content was:
> “Purposefully dumb.”
Which, in fairness, is accurate.
But apparently it was also bannable.
A 28-day mute followed.
Then a permanent ban from a different sub, for the crime of posting something I made…
in r/somethingimade.
At this point the Universe took notice.
Not in a dramatic way.
Not in a thunder-and-lightning way.
More in a “sighs deeply and reaches for administrative supplies” way.
And that’s when a letter arrived.
Not through my inbox.
Not via notifications.
It simply materialized on my counter, smelling faintly of lemon polish and municipal disappointment.
It read:
FORM 9B-S — COSM C COMPLA NT: SHORT FORM
(note: the letter “i” has been removed per mayoral decree)
To Whomever
Generates These
Ontolog cal D srupt ons:
STOP.
Sgned,
The Mayor of London-sh Thngs
(who s havng a day)
🍗 (Pundcat ve Poultry Pass attached)
This would have been alarming, except Gerald was nearby wearing a pair of pince-nez spectacles and rotating thoughtfully, as if considering the metaphysical weight of bureaucracy.
He tapped the form.
“I DON’T LIKE THIS,”
he declared, which caused a light quake in the dish rack.
Before I could respond, a second document fluttered out of nowhere, bound in a handsome burgundy cover labeled:
FORM 9B-L — LONG COMPLA NT
Created Out of Spte. Archved Out of Regret.
Annotat ons added by Sent ent B nder #442-A
> “Please stop rantng nto offcal documents.”
— the B nder, slghtly curled at the edges
The Mayor, apparently, has been keeping a list of Gerald-related grievances:
“Rearranged the clouds.”
“Kn ghted a loaf of bread.”
“Moved a hol day.”
“Caused candles to weep during rush hour.”
My personal favorite, written angrily in the margin:
> “I am T RED.”
(the Binder reduced the number of underlines from four to one)
Meanwhile, Gerald read none of this.
He simply produced a chicken leg, placed it solemnly upon the form, and pronounced:
> “THIS IS MY SIGNATURE.”
The leg glowed faintly.
The Binder made a distressed sound.
The Mayor, wherever he was, likely felt a chill.
And just like that—
with one silent stamp of poultry authority—
the entire matter became canon.
CONCLUSION (as much as this Universe allows)
Somewhere in the London-ish district, the Mayor updates his forms.
Somewhere in the Universal Archive, a Binder grieves softly.
Somewhere across Reddit, mods are muting people out of confusion.
And Gerald?
Gerald approves.
