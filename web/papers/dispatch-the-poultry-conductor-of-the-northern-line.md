The Poultry Conductor of the Northern Line
DISPATCH #5 — Gerald Enters the Underground
This morning I made the mistake of trying to take the Tube.
Not a big mistake like summoning a time paradox, or microwaving a tinfoil hat for warmth, but definitely in the top ten.
I walked into King’s Cross, minding my business, when every digital sign suddenly changed to:
“SERVICE DELAYED
DUE TO:
CHICKEN?”
I didn’t think much of it at first.
It’s London.
It happens.
Then I heard the announcement:
“Mind the gap.
And mind the chicken.
Especially the chicken.”
Before I could process that, the escalator sped up like it was late for an appointment and deposited me directly onto the platform — where I found... Gerald.
Not riding the Tube.
Driving it.
He was inside the conductor’s cab, perched confidently on the control panel, one wingbone resting on the throttle like he’d been doing this since the Victorian era.
He’d even stolen the Tube driver’s hat.
It didn’t fit.
He wore it with enormous authority anyway.
The doors slid open with a sound like a sigh that had given up on life.
Gerald gestured me forward with the solemn dignity of a maître d’.
“Sweetie,” he projected directly into my skull,
“all aboard for the existential loop.”
I stepped inside because, frankly after the week I've been having, I have stopped resisting destiny, poultry-based or otherwise.
The moment the doors closed, the train shot forward so fast the advertisements peeled off the walls.
Passengers screamed, but politely — in that British way where you apologize while you’re being horrified.
We rocketed through stations without stopping:
Euston (too judgmental)
Warren Street (bad vibes)
Oxford Circus (hadn’t earned it)
Piccadilly Circus (apparently Gerald refuses to stop anywhere circuses are involved)
At one point we passed a train going the opposite direction.
Gerald saluted.
The train bowed.
Then, with no warning:
Lights off.
Train silent.
Everything stops.
Gerald turns around slowly, neck stump glowing like a holy nightlight, a feint whisp of smoke billowingfrom under his conductor hat.
In my mind, I hear:
“Sweetie…
this is your stop.”
The doors open.
We’re not at a station.
We’re in some kind of stretch of tunnel that absolutely should not exist, lit by a single flickering bulb and smelling faintly of grapes.
I step out because arguing is useless.
The doors close.
Gerald gives me one last telepathic wink and the train vanishes into the dark like a spiritual ferret.
A moment later, my phone buzzes:
“You have arrived at:
Somewhere You’ll Understand Eventually.”
Great.
Anyway, that’s Dispatch #5.
Gerald now drives the Northern line.
God save London.
