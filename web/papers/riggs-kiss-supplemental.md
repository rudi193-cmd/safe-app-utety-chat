## The Reframe

Everyone knows Keep It Simple, Stupid.

The comma is an insult. The comma makes the instruction about the person. It suggests that the failure to simplify is a character defect — that a simpler person would have made a simpler thing.

This is wrong, and it is counterproductive.

The correct formulation is: **Keep It Stupid Simple.**

No comma. The modifier now describes the target, not the engineer. The goal is not for *you* to be simple. The goal is for the *thing* to be so simple that stupidity cannot break it.

This is a design specification, not an accusation.

## Why Engineers Overcomplicate

Three reasons. All of them understandable. None of them acceptable.

**1. They are proud of their knowledge and want to demonstrate it.**

A complex mechanism proves you understand complex mechanisms. A simple one doesn't prove anything — which means the knowledge is invisible. This feels like a loss. It isn't.

**2. They are afraid of looking unsophisticated.**

Simple solutions get questioned. "Is that all it does?" Yes. It does that one thing. Without failing.

**3. They designed for the interesting case, not the common case.**

The common case is boring. The common case doesn't require cleverness. But the common case is what runs ten thousand times a day. Design for that.

## The Rules

**The exit must be smaller than the system.**

If your solution requires more infrastructure than the problem it solves, you have not solved the problem. You have added a second problem.

**One bite at a time.**

Do not design the whole system. Design the first piece. Test it. Learn what you didn't know you didn't know. Proceed with that knowledge.

The balloon test: a beginner learning embouchure cannot practice on a trumpet. Start with the balloon. Just the breath. Just the shape of the air. One thing, fully learned, before the next thing.

**The three-layer rule.**

Do not recurse deeper than three layers. If understanding your solution requires understanding a system that requires understanding a subsystem that requires understanding a sub-subsystem — stop. Return to the surface. The complexity has exceeded the mechanism's need.

## What K.I.S.S. Is Not

It is not: don't think hard.

It is not: don't use sophisticated mechanisms. Sometimes sophisticated mechanisms are correct. The sophistication should be invisible to the user.

It is not: cut corners on safety. A simple safety mechanism is harder to build than a complex one. Do the work.

It is not: don't learn. Learn everything. Then use the minimum of it.

## The Demonstration

*[Riggs reaches into her jacket pocket and sets the knife on the table.]*

Handmade slipjoint pocket knife. Scales are slightly uneven — I was learning. Brass pins are off-center. The finish has been worn down from years of use.

One working part: the backspring. It does two jobs — it holds the blade open under tension, and it provides the detent that holds the blade closed. One part. Two functions. No screws in the pivot. No lock mechanism. No button to push.

*[She opens it. Closes it.]*

Chk-thk.

Still works. No battery. No app. Nothing to update. Nothing to fail that cannot be fixed with a file and fifteen minutes.

That is K.I.S.S.

Go build something stupid simple.
