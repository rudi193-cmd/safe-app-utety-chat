The Royal Proclamation of Sir Gerald’s Radiant Health
⭐ DISPATCH #12 — *The Royal Health Proclamation
⭐ DISPATCH #12 — *The Royal Health Proclamation
I knew something was off the moment the ravens started circling Buckingham Palace in a perfect Fibonacci spiral.
That’s rarely a good sign.
Historically, it means:

an omen
a coronation
or that someone left a sausage roll unattended near the gift shop
But this time the ravens were carrying a scroll.
A scroll sealed with wax.
Royal wax.
Royal wax that smelled faintly of thyme and citrus and whatever emotion an immaculate glove contains.
A footman intercepted me at the gate. He looked like he hadn’t slept since the Tudors.
“His Majesty requires your presence,” he said,
as though this were an ordinary sentence
and not the kind of thing that usually precedes historical footnotes.
I was escorted through the Palace’s north entrance, past corridors that definitely weren’t on the public tour and probably weren’t on any map. One hallway bent in three dimensions. Another had portraits that turned away politely as we passed, to avoid eavesdropping.
We stopped in the Monarch’s Study.
There, standing beside a desk stacked with drafts, quills, and an emergency bag of Percy Pigs, was His Majesty King Chardles III himself.
He wore the Look — the one that suggests he’s spent the morning speaking gently to a grove of tomatoes and has been emotionally validated by them.
“Ah,” he said, spotting me. “You’re the one who keeps encountering him.”
He didn’t have to specify who “him” was.
On the desk lay a parchment several feet long, sealed and resealed an impossible number of times. The top line read:
> THE ROYAL PROCLAMATION OF HEALTH, VIGOUR, AND ROTISSERIE BRILLIANCE
> IN TRIBUTE TO SIR GERALD OF THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN CHARD
Chardles cleared his throat with centuries of ceremony behind it.
“We have learned,” he said, “that a… gentleman in California has issued what appears to be a medical memorandum.”
I nodded.
“A memo about a… president’s brain,” he continued delicately, like the topic might stain the wallpaper. “And so it has come to my attention that the Crown has, ah… failed to issue any such declaration regarding Sir Gerald.”
He looked mortified.
“I adore that chicken,” he whispered.
He gestured for the Royal Physician.
Dr. Archibald Spleenforth approached us looking like a man who’d attempted to take Gerald’s pulse and instead learned three new dimensions.
“I have completed the examination, sire,” he said, his left eye twitching in Morse code.
Chardles nodded gravely. “Proceed.”
Spleenforth unrolled the scroll.
It unrolled across the desk.
Then across the floor.
Then under the door.
Then down the corridor.
Then, faintly, into the gardens.
The proclamation read as follows:

THE HEALTH OF SIR GERALD
(As Observed, Interpreted, and Survived)

Pulse:
Unmeasurable by mortal instruments.
Possibly faster than time.
Possibly happening before the measurement.
Temperature:
“Perfectly roasted.”
(The thermometer caught fire, apologized, and resigned.)
Bone Density:
Approaches mythic.
Comparable to cathedral pillars forged of hope and herb seasoning.
Aura:
“Golden. Rotational. Bureaucratically serene.”
Cholesterol:
Irrelevant.
Transcendent beings do not accumulate lipids.
Neurological activity:
Non-local.
Resides simultaneously in:
Dryer #14
The Northern Line
The concept of grapes
And one place the doctor refused to name for legal reasons.
General Condition:
Excellent.
Beyond Excellent.
The Standard by Which Excellence is Now Measured.

At the bottom, in Chardles’s own careful hand:
> “We hereby declare Sir Gerald
> to be in Radiant Good Health,
> in Perpetual Grace,
> and of Eternal Rotisserie Constitution.
> Long may he rotate.”
Chardles exhaled, trembling slightly with relief.
“It is done,” he murmured.
“We have fulfilled our obligation.”
At that moment, a warm breeze drifted through the sealed windows.
A faint smell of rosemary.
A soft, dignified pop.
And there was Gerald.
Standing atop the proclamation.
Rotating just enough to be threatening to physics.
He looked at the King.
The King looked at him.
And then — in a gesture reserved only for heads of state and beloved gardeners — Gerald extended one perfect grape and placed it gently into the King’s gloved hand.
Chardles bowed.
A monarch bowing to a chicken.
And somehow, cosmically, it felt correct.
Gerald vanished.
The grape remained, glowing faintly like good news.
The King whispered:
“Bless him.
He really is in excellent health.”
I left the Palace in a quiet daze, the ravens dispersing overhead, murmuring the word “excellent” in tones of bureaucratic reverence.
Somewhere in the city, a Tube train honked respectfully.
