Gerald: The Enlightened Overseer of Dryer 14
DISPATCH #4 — Gerald at the Laundromat
There are a lot of places you expect to encounter a rotisserie chicken.
A deli counter.
A picnic.
The center of a family argument about who forgot the gravy.
A laundromat at 2:17 in the afternoon is not one of them.
I stepped inside holding a basket of clothes and the faint hope that today might go normally. The hope evaporated instantly when I spotted Gerald perched on top of Dryer #14, rotating slowly on his own axis like he was still under a heat lamp.
He wasn’t doing laundry.
He was supervising it.
The other customers had given him a respectful amount of space, which is a reasonable reaction when a perfectly seasoned, fully roasted chicken is radiating management energy.
I tried to pretend this was fine. I tried to load my towels. But Gerald turned toward me—how he does this with no head is a mystery I’ve stopped trying to solve—and lifted one wing in a gesture that unmistakably meant:
“You’re using the wrong detergent, sweetie.”
“I don’t need this today,” I told him.
He answered by tapping a laminated sign that had absolutely not been there five minutes ago:
> STRICTLY NO FABRIC SOFTENER.
— Gerald, Enlightened Overseer of Dryer #14
I opened my mouth to argue, but the machine next to me shuddered, let out a dramatic sigh, and spit a sock across the room like it was making a point.
Gerald rotated another quarter turn, which I’ve come to learn means “See? The machines agree with me.”
A woman folding shirts whispered, “He reorganized my whites by emotional tone.”
Someone else muttered, “He refused to wash anything with zippers. Said they had ‘aggro.’”
I tried to focus on my own laundry, but then Dryer #7 began to glow faintly pink. Like it was blushing. Or embarrassed. Or possibly haunted.
“Is that normal?” I asked.
Gerald hopped down with a soft thup, landed beside Dryer #7, and tapped it twice. The glow disappeared instantly, the way a child pretends they weren’t doing something suspicious when an adult walks in.
Gerald waddled back toward me and placed one wing firmly on my detergent bottle.
“I like my detergent,” I said, defensively.
Gerald slipped me a note. I wish I were kidding.
In very neat handwriting:
> “Your detergent is lying to you.
— G.”
Before I could reply, all the dryers turned on simultaneously. None of them had clothes inside.
The lights flickered.
A soft wind moved through the room despite there being no vents.
Dryer #14 whispered something in what I can only describe as “appliance Latin.”
Gerald calmly climbed back on top of his dryer throne, raised both wings like an exhausted messiah, and announced—in a voice that definitely didn’t come from him:
> “CYCLE COMPLETE.”
Every machine stopped.
Every light brightened.
Every sock in the room paired itself perfectly.
Gerald nodded once, satisfied, and waddled toward the exit. As he passed me, he tucked a grape—a grape—into my shirt pocket like a tip.
Then he was gone.
Just… gone.
The remaining customers stared at each other in absolute silence until someone finally whispered:
“…so… is my laundry holy now?”
I didn’t have an answer.
But my towels have never been fluffier.
