The Albuquerque Paradox: Dissolving the Controller-Plant Distinction
[US] Experiment in Albuquerque May Invalidate “Controller vs. Plant” Distinction — Need Second Opinion
Hi all — posting from Albuquerque.
I’m trying to sanity-check something after reading the recent thread about objective control relations (the one breaking down plant P and controller C with sensing, actuation, and goal structure).
I think my system breaks the distinction.
The short version:
I was running a very normal closed-loop test (P = tabletop mechanical oscillator, C = microcontroller) when an unmodeled agent entered the lab, inspected the setup, and began making adjustments without belonging to either subsystem.
The strange part:

The agent sensed P
It tapped the oscillator twice, nodded, and rearranged the calibration weights.
The agent actuated C
It pressed the reset button on the controller (with surprising confidence).
The agent created a feedback loop
It watched the system respond, then stole my pen and wrote something on a sticky note that said only “no.”
The agent imposed its own goal structure
The revised system behavior did not match the original optimization target.
It matched whatever the agent preferred, which appears to be “moving the weights into a small pyramid.”
So now I have a system where:
P affects C,
C affects P,
and a third entity affects both while claiming to be neither,
AND the system stabilizes around its internal objective.
My colleague insists this “agent” is named Gerald or possibly “Geraldo” (the handwriting alternates).
My question for the sub:
Does this count as a violation of the objective controller/plant relation,
or does Albuquerque just have unusually porous boundary conditions?
If helpful, I can upload the footage, though it’s VHS quality and the agent appears briefly on a 90s talk show in the middle of the recording.
Thanks in advance for any analysis (or roast),
