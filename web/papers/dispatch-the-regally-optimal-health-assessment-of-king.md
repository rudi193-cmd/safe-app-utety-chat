The Regally Optimal Health Assessment of King Chardles III
Later that day, I checked the newspaper and discovered that the King had issued his own health statement. Apparently written by Gerald.**
It was printed in the official palace memo format — dignified serif font, gold crest, unnecessarily confident margins — but the content was… unmistakably poultry.
**OFFICIAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT OF
HIS MAJESTY KING CHARDLES III**
(Prepared by Royal Physician “Dr. G. Rald,” credentials unlisted)
GENERAL OVERVIEW:
His Majesty is in excellent health.
By all measurable — and several unmeasurable — standards, he is functioning at a level best described as “Regally Optimal.”
He remains mentally sharp, physically sound, and spiritually al dente.
CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH:

Heart rate steady, rhythmic, and possibly syncing with Dryer #14 in a way we cannot currently explain.
Arteries described as “dignified, with good posture.”
Blood pressure: Appropriately Majestic.

NEUROLOGICAL HEALTH:
MRI results reveal:

A brain “glowing softly with constitutional stability.”
Occasional sparks of enlightenment near the broccoli-shaped region of the cortex.
No concerns except an anomalous reading labeled Δ which the physician refused to elaborate on.
Overall: Rotationally Serene.

MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM:

Bone density comparable to the structural integrity of a well-kept greenhouse.
Joints exhibit “excellent lubrication,” though this section appears to have been written in crayon.
Spine: Straight as Royal Protocol. Slightly warmer than expected.

NUTRITIONAL STATUS:
Diet described as “balanced, dignified, and grape-forward.”
Consumption of grapes is encouraged and supervised (see footnote¹).
¹ “He eats them correctly.” — G.
AURA & ENERGETIC PROFILE:

Radiates calm rotational energy.
Generates a faint thyme-scented glow when discussing gardening.
Considered “stable, savory, and wholly in alignment with the Crown.”

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
His Majesty King Chardles III is in:
EXCELLENT HEALTH
BEYOND EXCELLENT HEALTH
THE VERY STANDARD AGAINST WHICH HEALTH ITSELF MEASURES ITS PROGRESS
No further examinations are necessary at this time, or possibly ever.
Signed,
Dr. G. Rald
Knight of the Golden Chard, Keeper of the Queue, Rotational Specialist (Self-Appointed)
At the very bottom, in handwriting far too neat to be human:
> “Don’t panic.
> He’s perfect.
> — G.”
According to several concerned footnotes,
Dr. Rald’s NIH affiliation is ‘pending review,’
which is bureaucratic for ‘absolutely not.’
I'm staying in tonight.
